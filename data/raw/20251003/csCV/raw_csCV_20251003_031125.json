      "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on\ngeneral visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in\nspecialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and\nexpensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that\nleverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our\napproach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled\ndata using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we\nselectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,\nenabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge\nduring distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA\ndemonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under\nminimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML\nframework.",

      "title": "Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping",
      "summary": "GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel\ncoordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for\ncurrent VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which\nbreaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.\nCurrent approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual\nfeatures, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings\nimplicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new\nresolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER\ntokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference\npositions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate\ncoordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial\nencoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,\naddressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on\nScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in\ngrounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution\ninterfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on\nimplicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across\ndiverse resolutions and platforms.",

      "summary": "We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:\nimperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a\nmodel. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,\nwhich can lead to information loss, we propose to \"combat noise with noise\" by\nleveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing\ninformation loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to\nthe input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them\nbefore mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our\nmethod recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%\non stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of\nadversarial attacks.",

In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the\nfirst MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model.

      "summary": "Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world\nmodeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a\nrepresentative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate\nnatural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency\nwhen revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must\ncompress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which\nexposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,\nwhereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene\ngeneration quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.\nWe present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols\nwith a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct\ngameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during\nexploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward\nTraining extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained\npredictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial\nmemory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently\nretrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,\nwhile Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior\nlong-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse\nenvironments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended\nsequences.",

In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder\nthat integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of\nVQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in\nterms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and\ntheir continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior\nwork achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up\nto 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between\ncodebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with\nvector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such\nthat the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the\nembedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ\nthat help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that\nPQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models.

Inspired by the\nhierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR\nmodel, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and\nextracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator\nextracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it\ninto latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic\nprocessing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the\nVersatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of\nreconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.",

      "title": "GeoComplete: Geometry-Aware Diffusion for Reference-Driven Image\n  Completion",
      "summary": "Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target\nview using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view\ndiffers significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely\nsolely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or\ndepth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete\nachieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly\nboosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.",

      "summary": "Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in\nopen-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded\non pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and\nCLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit\nof geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In\nprinciple, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such\nas pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic\nfeatures offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical\nquestions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware\nsemantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones\ncontain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does\ngeometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no\nsignificant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable\nhigher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work\nand their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for\ninverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core\ncomponents: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion\nusing photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose\nestimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results\nsuggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range\nof downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric\ndetail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on\neffective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and\nperformance of pretrained semantic features.",

      "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in\nrapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few\nuser images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead\nto concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and\nunauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,\nthe idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image\npoisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited\nimperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images\nwith noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based\nperturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion\nmodels. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying\nthe starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This\ntrajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high\nvisual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and\npersonalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates\nunlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a\npractical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We\nvalidate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness\nagainst state-of-the-art inversion attacks.

Our\nmethod achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77\non the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised\nand unsupervised baselines.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the\nbest-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only\nand tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble\napproach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in\nfreshness prediction.

      "summary": "Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed\nmedical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and\ndisjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training.

Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely\non uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to\nincorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified\nRelevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a\nquery-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to\nyield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak\nalignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating\nmechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method\nseamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without\nadditional supervision.

Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class\nAdaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both\nobject recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that\nadaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),\nand, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We\nformulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions\nare generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.\nThis cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood\n(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving\nclass distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with\nuncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic\nunderstanding and its contextual confidence.

      "title": "MoGIC: Boosting Motion Generation via Intention Understanding and Visual\n  Context",
      "summary": "Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a\nbidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in\ncapturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that\ndrive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and\npersonalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal\ndetails. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention\nmodeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly\noptimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,\nMoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance\ngeneration, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further\nintroduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable\neffective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.\nTo support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21\nhigh-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC\nreduces FID by 38.6\\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based\nmethods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables\nintention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable\nmotion synthesis and intention understanding.

      "title": "FSFSplatter: Build Surface and Novel Views with Sparse-Views within 3min",
      "summary": "Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for\nits high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,\nmost existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free\nsparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and\noverfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface\nreconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense\nGaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced\nscene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to\nencode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent\nGaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates\nlocal floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to\nlimited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with\ndifferentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter\noutperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.",

      "summary": "Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image\ngeneration. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes\nthem poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image\nquality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by\nperturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient\nand unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise\nperturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO\nemploys an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,\nevaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution\ntoward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves\nboth reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our\nresults suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching\nframeworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned\ngeneration.",

      "title": "Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light\n  Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles",
      "summary": "Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)\nbecause perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In\naddition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing\nperturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous\nmisclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal\ncontinuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both\ndigital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,\nsequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the\nUSA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and\nself-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of\nRGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):\nhighway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life\napplication of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer\ndefense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive\ndistillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise\ntemporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included\naccuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,\nand confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes\nfor recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved\n79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and\nBEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.",

      "title": "Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA",
      "summary": "Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and\ncritical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision\nbased applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging\ndue to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural\nnetworks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists\nin retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to\nmitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the\ncontinually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)\nreliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance\ndegradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.\nIn this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more\nexpressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose\nreparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected\nfunctions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic\nconditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic\nforgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.\nExtensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,\nshowcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method\nsurpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching\nhigher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the\nmemory cost and sampling time.",

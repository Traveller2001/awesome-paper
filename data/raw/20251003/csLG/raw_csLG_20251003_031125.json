      "title": "Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning\n  with Verifiable Reward",
      "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large\nLanguage Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by\na training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,\nsignaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.

      "title": "To Distill or Decide? Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in\n  Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning",
      "summary": "Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning\n(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent\nempirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages\navailability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a\nsimulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to\ndisentangle the task of \"learning to see\" from \"learning to act\". While expert\ndistillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state\ninformation, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through\na simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and\ncontrolled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we\ninvestigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation\nand standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The\ntrade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as\ntheoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief\ncontraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is\nnot always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new\nguidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially\nadvancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially\nobservable domains.",

      "summary": "LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects\none via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult\ntasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a\nkey advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade\nwhen increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show\nBoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.",

      "summary": "The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population\nmay participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the\npopulation to represent more features than the number of neurons. In\nneuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to\nwhich different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar\ninformation. In this work, we explore a critical question: \\textit{does\nsuperposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We\nhypothesize that models which represent the same features in \\textit{different\nsuperposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear\ncombinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics\n(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment\nthan expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics\nare dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse\nautoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment\nscores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced\nwith its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for\nDNN\\(\\rightarrow\\)DNN and DNN\\(\\rightarrow\\)brain linear regression alignment\nin the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is\nnecessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment\nbetween neural codes.",

      "summary": "Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in\nmathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most\nexisting physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture\nreasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic\nLLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability\nand diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation\nframework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are\nrepresented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding\ncausal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,\ninterpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of\nthe DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a\nfully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we\ndeveloped, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without\nheuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned\nwith human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal\npersistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both\ndiagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural\nrigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides\na principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the\ndevelopment of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.",

      "summary": "We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution\nshifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov\nDecision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions\nmay suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,\nsuch changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction\nwith the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm\n(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution\nshifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To\naddress this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware\nQ-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect\ndistribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty\nestimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between\nexploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB\nachieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the\ncomputational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by\nhaving a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient\nhospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.",

In this work, we provide a\nprincipled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a\ngeneralization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local\ncurvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits\ndesirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically\nthat this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with\nmean-squared error and cross-entropy losses.

One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active\nLearning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize\nthat an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly\naffect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high\ncalibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even\nworse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we\npropose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the\nhighest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we\nutilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and\nformally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration\nerror on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data.

Our starting point is the observation that\nseemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures\nfor standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course\nof generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated\ndecoding strategies?\n  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which\nuses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness\nto verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk\non a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the\nprocess verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs\nprobabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random\nwalk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and\nsampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our\nwork is to highlight parallels with this literature.

This capability\nempowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control\ndecisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We\nintroduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,\nranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived\nfrom observed terminal departures.

On-device retraining with\na target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains\nimpractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the\ncomputational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all\nlayers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers\nfor retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model\nbackpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for\nconstrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection\napproach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their\nactivation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet\nallows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for\nretraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating\nAdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves\nan average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based\nbaselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.",

      "summary": "We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during\ntraining. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key\nfor interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving\nperformance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data\nintroduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature\nimportance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and\ntask-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on\nchanges in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We\ntheoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how\nGNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph\nstructure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training\nconcludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively\ndropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and\nalso evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify\nthe flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its\nadaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.",

This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in\nlarge-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate\nstructures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of\nscore distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of\nsampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.\nHowever, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably\nlow designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to\nappropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score\ndistillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which\nsignificantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to\ntheir pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined\nwith inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that\nour distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in\nsampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and\nnovelty as the Proteina teacher model.

We propose ContextFlow, a novel context-aware flow\nmatching framework that incorporates prior knowledge to guide the inference of\nstructural tissue dynamics from spatially resolved omics data. Specifically,\nContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor\ncommunication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes\nthe optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,\nContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent\nbut also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for\nmodeling spatiotemporal dynamics from longitudinal, spatially resolved omics\ndata. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and\nqualitative metrics of inference accuracy and biological coherence.

To date,\ncontinual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of\nrisk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected\n(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal\ntheoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware\ndecision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of\nlong-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical\ntheory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in\nnon-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the\ncontinual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure\ntheory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk\nmeasures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a\ncase study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,\nwhich show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk\nmeasures.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive\nSparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly\ndesigned for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least\nsquares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically\ndistinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative\nbackward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a\nsparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health\noutcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we\ndevelop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to\nmaximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically\nchallenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact\nLightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without\ncompromising interpretability.

However, during\nthe threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity\nof the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside\nor outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this\npaper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose\nenhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation\n(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance\nof the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent\nabrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction\nintervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that\nthese functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods\nwhile maintaining coverage validity.",

A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve\ngeneralization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the\nkernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of\n$O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,\nincurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we\nestablish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by\ncarefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only\npolynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the\ndata are NTK separable from the margin $\\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate\nof $\\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \\gamma L^2) / (n \\gamma^2))$, which aligns with the\noptimal SVM-type rate $\\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \\gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent\nfactors.

      "summary": "Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network\ntraining, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar\ngradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a\ndiversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an\napproximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously\noverlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally\nnon-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively\noptimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with\ninhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,\nresulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any\nobjective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze\nfeedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher\nframework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons\nexhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of\nthe original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to\ngradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the\nsolution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of\nstability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In\nother cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to\ngradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by\ntemporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures\ncapable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an\nimportant counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in\nneural networks.",

      "summary": "Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and\nclustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great\nsuccess, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive\nobjective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually\nreinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability\nin representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against\nseveral state-of-the-art CAGC methods.",

      "summary": "Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for\noptimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme.

To pinpoint the research\nobjective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a\nfundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time\nseries forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,\ne.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related\nto window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting\nparadigm of deep time series models.

      "title": "EvoSpeak: Large Language Models for Interpretable Genetic\n  Programming-Evolved Heuristics",
      "summary": "Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving\ntree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic\nand large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly\ncomplex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting\ntransferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,\na novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to\nenhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.\nEvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and\nleverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate\nconvergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language\nexplanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge\ntransfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We\nverify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic\nflexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective\nformulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective\nheuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable\nreports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP\nwith the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the\ndevelopment of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for\nreal-world optimization problems.",

      "summary": "Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning\nmappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex\ndynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning\nmechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators\ninto two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)\nFunctional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several\nviewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven\ndynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to\nexplain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural\noperator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this\nexplanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent\nneed for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple\ndual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that\ndual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn\ncomplex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the\ncritical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into\nneural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden\nphysical phenomena.",

      "summary": "The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of\nparameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient\ndeployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing\nlow-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical\nstability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization\noverhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an\nexponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently\nexhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this\narises naturally from $\\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic\ngradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our\nanalysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which\nmotivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we\npropose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with\nentropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs\nup to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%\nthroughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no\ndeviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a\nstatistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless\nlow-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.",

      "summary": "We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules\n(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz\nmapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron\ndistribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference\nbetween small and large learning rates $\\eta$. With a learning rate below a\ntopological critical point $\\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve\nall topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\\eta^*$, the\nlearning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron\nmanifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.\nViewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability\nphenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can\nbe divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under\ntopological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through\ndrastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is\nindependent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal\napplication of topological methods to the study of deep learning.",

      "summary": "As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,\nit is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of\ntutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,\nprovide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce\nTutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate\nthe core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated\nby human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples\nare drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive\nexplanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable\nfeedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through\neffective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,\nsamples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge\nmodel responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained\nautomatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific\nrubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed\nanalysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the\nfrontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\\%$, showing a large room for\nimprovement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of\ntutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,\nwith all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\\%$ pass rate on rubric\ncriteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families\nexhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others\nin supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use\ncases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated\nbenchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.",

This method involves analysing the coupled\nvehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to\nassess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical\nand dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting\nthe effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for\noptimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An\nunsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used\nto reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses.\nThe mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are\noptimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index\ndistributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is\nemployed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify\noptimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional\nparameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3\nand 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,\nwhile those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower\nnatural frequencies for optimal detection.

      "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language\nmodels(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA\nassumes a uniform rank \\textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting\nfor the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and\nlayers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize\nupdates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank\nallocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training\nprocess, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high\ncomputational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel\nframework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a\nhypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value\nDecomposition $(P, \\Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on\nattention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the\noutputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank\nallocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and\nmodels demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without\nsacrificing performance.

      "title": "h1: Bootstrapping LLMs to Reason over Longer Horizons via Reinforcement\n  Learning",
      "summary": "Large language models excel at short-horizon reasoning tasks, but performance\ndrops as reasoning horizon lengths increase. Existing approaches to combat this\nrely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of\nwhich scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon\ndata. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,\nmulti-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data\nusing outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in\ncomplexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.\nEmpirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on\ncomposed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,\ncompetition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.\nImportantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than\nbaselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning\npaths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards\nachieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon\ntraining, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1\ntherefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon\nproblems using only existing data.",

      "summary": "While Language Models (LMs) have made significant progress in automating\nmachine learning engineering (MLE), the acquisition of high-quality MLE\ntraining data is significantly constrained. Current MLE benchmarks suffer from\nlow scalability and limited applicability because they rely on static, manually\ncurated tasks, demanding extensive time and manual effort to produce. We\nintroduce MLE-Smith, a fully automated multi-agent pipeline, to transform raw\ndatasets into competition-style MLE challenges through an efficient\ngenerate-verify-execute paradigm for scaling MLE tasks with verifiable quality,\nreal-world usability, and rich diversity. The proposed multi-agent pipeline in\nMLE-Smith drives structured task design and standardized refactoring, coupled\nwith a hybrid verification mechanism that enforces strict structural rules and\nhigh-level semantic soundness. It further validates empirical solvability and\nreal-world fidelity through interactive execution. We apply MLE-Smith to 224 of\nreal-world datasets and generate 606 tasks spanning multiple categories,\nobjectives, and modalities, demonstrating that MLE-Smith can work effectively\nacross a wide range of real-world datasets. Evaluation on the generated tasks\nshows that the performance of eight mainstream and cutting-edge LLMs on\nMLE-Smith tasks is strongly correlated with their performance on carefully\nhuman-designed tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the MLE-Smith to\nscaling up MLE tasks, while maintaining task quality.",

      "summary": "Molecular graph representation learning is widely used in chemical and\nbiomedical research. While pre-trained 2D graph encoders have demonstrated\nstrong performance, they overlook the rich molecular domain knowledge\nassociated with submolecular instances (atoms and bonds). While molecular\npre-training approaches incorporate such knowledge into their pre-training\nobjectives, they typically employ designs tailored to a specific type of\nknowledge, lacking the flexibility to integrate diverse knowledge present in\nmolecules. Hence, reusing widely available and well-validated pre-trained 2D\nencoders, while incorporating molecular domain knowledge during downstream\nadaptation, offers a more practical alternative. In this work, we propose\nMolGA, which adapts pre-trained 2D graph encoders to downstream molecular\napplications by flexibly incorporating diverse molecular domain knowledge.\nFirst, we propose a molecular alignment strategy that bridge the gap between\npre-trained topological representations with domain-knowledge representations.\nSecond, we introduce a conditional adaptation mechanism that generates\ninstance-specific tokens to enable fine-grained integration of molecular domain\nknowledge for downstream tasks. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on\neleven public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of MolGA.",

      "summary": "Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering\nbut constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space.\nProtein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM)\nexhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by\ninterpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as\ninverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert\ndemonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this\nperspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two\ncomplementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from\nretrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints\ndistilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure\nrepresentations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding\ncalibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational\nassays; >2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the\ntraining data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm\nthat within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving\nrobustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths.

      "summary": "The escalating complexity of network threats and the inherent class imbalance\nin traffic data present formidable challenges for modern Intrusion Detection\nSystems (IDS). While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in modeling topological\nstructures and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) are proficient in\ncapturing time-series dependencies, a framework that synergistically integrates\nboth while explicitly addressing data imbalance remains an open challenge. This\npaper introduces a novel deep learning framework, named Gated Temporal\nConvolutional Network and Graph (GTCN-G), engineered to overcome these\nlimitations. Our model uniquely fuses a Gated TCN (G-TCN) for extracting\nhierarchical temporal features from network flows with a Graph Convolutional\nNetwork (GCN) designed to learn from the underlying graph structure. The core\ninnovation lies in the integration of a residual learning mechanism,\nimplemented via a Graph Attention Network (GAT). This mechanism preserves\noriginal feature information through residual connections, which is critical\nfor mitigating the class imbalance problem and enhancing detection sensitivity\nfor rare malicious activities (minority classes). We conducted extensive\nexperiments on two public benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15 and ToN-IoT, to\nvalidate our approach. The empirical results demonstrate that the proposed\nGTCN-G model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming\nexisting baseline models in both binary and multi-class classification tasks.",

      "summary": "We present an algorithm guaranteeing dynamic regret bounds for online\nomniprediction with long term constraints. The goal in this recently introduced\nproblem is for a learner to generate a sequence of predictions which are\nbroadcast to a collection of downstream decision makers. Each decision maker\nhas their own utility function, as well as a vector of constraint functions,\neach mapping their actions and an adversarially selected state to reward or\nconstraint violation terms. The downstream decision makers select actions \"as\nif\" the state predictions are correct, and the goal of the learner is to\nproduce predictions such that all downstream decision makers choose actions\nthat give them worst-case utility guarantees while minimizing worst-case\nconstraint violation. Within this framework, we give the first algorithm that\nobtains simultaneous \\emph{dynamic regret} guarantees for all of the agents --\nwhere regret for each agent is measured against a potentially changing sequence\nof actions across rounds of interaction, while also ensuring vanishing\nconstraint violation for each agent. Our results do not require the agents\nthemselves to maintain any state -- they only solve one-round constrained\noptimization problems defined by the prediction made at that round.",

      "summary": "Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) trains policies that\nreach user-specified goals at test time, providing a simple, unsupervised,\ndomain-agnostic way to extract diverse behaviors from unlabeled, reward-free\ndatasets. Nonetheless, long-horizon decision making remains difficult for GCRL\nagents due to temporal credit assignment and error accumulation, and the\noffline setting amplifies these effects. To alleviate this issue, we introduce\nTest-Time Graph Search (TTGS), a lightweight planning approach to solve the\nGCRL task. TTGS accepts any state-space distance or cost signal, builds a\nweighted graph over dataset states, and performs fast search to assemble a\nsequence of subgoals that a frozen policy executes. When the base learner is\nvalue-based, the distance is derived directly from the learned goal-conditioned\nvalue function, so no handcrafted metric is needed. TTGS requires no changes to\ntraining, no additional supervision, no online interaction, and no privileged\ninformation, and it runs entirely at inference. On the OGBench benchmark, TTGS\nimproves success rates of multiple base learners on challenging locomotion\ntasks, demonstrating the benefit of simple metric-guided test-time planning for\noffline GCRL.",

      "title": "A Broader View of Thompson Sampling",
      "summary": "Thompson Sampling is one of the most widely used and studied bandit\nalgorithms, known for its simple structure, low regret performance, and solid\ntheoretical guarantees. Yet, in stark contrast to most other families of bandit\nalgorithms, the exact mechanism through which posterior sampling (as introduced\nby Thompson) is able to \"properly\" balance exploration and exploitation,\nremains a mystery. In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm. To distill this, a key conceptual tool is introduced, which we refer\nto as \"faithful\" stationarization of the regret formulation. Essentially, the\nfinite horizon dynamic optimization problem is converted into a stationary\ncounterpart which \"closely resembles\" the original objective (in contrast, the\nclassical infinite horizon discounted formulation, that leads to the Gittins\nindex, alters the problem and objective in too significant a manner). The newly\ncrafted time invariant objective can be studied using Bellman's principle which\nleads to a time invariant optimal policy. When viewed through this lens,\nThompson Sampling admits a simple online optimization form that mimics the\nstructure of the Bellman-optimal policy, and where greediness is regularized by\na measure of residual uncertainty based on point-biserial correlation. This\nanswers the question of how Thompson Sampling balances\nexploration-exploitation, and moreover, provides a principled framework to\nstudy and further improve Thompson's original idea.",

This paper advances MoE\ntheory by providing convergence guarantees for joint training of soft-routed\nMoE models with non-linear routers and experts in a student-teacher framework.\nWe prove that, with moderate over-parameterization, the student network\nundergoes a feature learning phase, where the router's learning process is\n``guided'' by the experts, that recovers the teacher's parameters.

Existing work has\nstudied pretraining poisoning assuming adversaries control a percentage of the\ntraining corpus. However, for large models, even small percentages translate to\nimpractically large amounts of data. This work demonstrates for the first time\nthat poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents\nregardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning\nexperiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on\nchinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens). We find that 250 poisoned\ndocuments similarly compromise models across all model and dataset sizes,\ndespite the largest models training on more than 20 times more clean data. We\nalso run smaller-scale experiments to ablate factors that could influence\nattack success, including broader ratios of poisoned to clean data and\nnon-random distributions of poisoned samples. Finally, we demonstrate the same\ndynamics for poisoning during fine-tuning.

      "summary": "Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,\nmulti-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on\nmulti-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent\ninference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless\nsingle-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,\nGemma, and GPT.

However, most\nCFL methods require the number of clusters K to be fixed a priori, which is\nimpractical when the latent structure is unknown. We propose DPMM-CFL, a CFL\nalgorithm that places a Dirichlet Process (DP) prior over the distribution of\ncluster parameters. This enables nonparametric Bayesian inference to jointly\ninfer both the number of clusters and client assignments, while optimizing\nper-cluster federated objectives. This results in a method where, at each\nround, federated updates and cluster inferences are coupled, as presented in\nthis paper. The algorithm is validated on benchmark datasets under Dirichlet\nand class-split non-IID partitions.",

However, such guarantees\nbreak down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may\nincur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$.

In this work, we investigate\nMixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to\nDropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout\nmitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned\nweights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby\nmaintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our\nstudy reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain\ngeneralization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9\nfor ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it\nyields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates\nmore strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting\nbetter generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking\nsubstantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by\nup to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%.

Differential Attention\naddressed this by using subtractive attention maps for signal and noise, but\nits required balanced head allocation imposes rigid constraints on\nrepresentational flexibility and scalability.\n  To overcome this, we propose Grouped Differential Attention (GDA), a novel\napproach that introduces unbalanced head allocation between signal-preserving\nand noise-control groups. GDA significantly enhances signal focus by\nstrategically assigning more heads to signal extraction and fewer to\nnoise-control, stabilizing the latter through controlled repetition (akin to\nGQA). This design achieves stronger signal fidelity with minimal computational\noverhead. We further extend this principle to group-differentiated growth, a\nscalable strategy that selectively replicates only the signal-focused heads,\nthereby ensuring efficient capacity expansion.\n  Through large-scale pretraining and continual training experiments, we\ndemonstrate that moderate imbalance ratios in GDA yield substantial\nimprovements in generalization and stability compared to symmetric baselines.\nOur results collectively establish that ratio-aware head allocation and\nselective expansion offer an effective and practical path toward designing\nscalable, computation-efficient Transformer architectures.",

We exploit the\nequivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the\ninterplay between the \\emph{effective dimension} and the \\emph{bias} of a model\ntowards a given task, investigating how these affect the model's training and\nperformance. We show that for a model that is completely agnostic, or unbiased,\ntowards the function to be learned, a higher effective dimension likely results\nin a better trainability and performance. On the other hand, for models that\nare biased towards the function to be learned a lower effective dimension is\nlikely beneficial during training. To obtain these results, we derive an\nanalytical expression of the FIM for Fourier models and identify the features\ncontrolling a model's effective dimension. This allows us to construct models\nwith tunable effective dimension and bias, and to compare their training. We\nfurthermore introduce a tensor network representation of the considered Fourier\nmodels, which could be a tool of independent interest for the analysis of QNN\nmodels.

      "summary": "Anomaly detection is a key task across domains such as industry, healthcare,\nand cybersecurity. Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing\nmultiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for\nsuch problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in\nthis field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge\ncomputing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces the \\textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural\nNetwork-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a\nnew detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather\nthan reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike\nTime-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural\nactivity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also\nproposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,\nassigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a\nsingle spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to\nconventional encoding methods. Experimental results on publicly available\ndatasets show that the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance\nwhile significantly reducing energy consumption, compared to a wide set of deep\nlearning and machine learning baselines. Furthermore, its practical utility is\nvalidated in a real-world case study, where the model successfully identifies\npower curtailment events in a solar inverter.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

We show\nthat frontier LLMs require excessive amounts of reasoning tokens to solve even\nbasic calculations, which is exacerbated by their tokenization strategies that\nsplit single numbers into multiple tokens. This motivates the need for\nefficient and effective single-token number encodings. We introduce a set of\ndesiderata for such encodings and show that existing approaches fail to fulfill\nthem. To address these shortcomings, we propose BitTokens, a novel tokenization\nstrategy that embeds any number into a single token using its IEEE 754 binary\nfloating-point representation. Through extensive experiments we show that our\nBitTokens allow even small language models to learn algorithms that solve basic\narithmetic operations nearly perfectly.

However, this benefit of test compute fades when attackers are\ngiven access to gradients or multimodal inputs. We address this gap, clarifying\nthat inference-compute offers benefits even in such cases. Our approach argues\nthat compositional generalization, through which OOD data is understandable via\nits in-distribution (ID) components, enables adherence to defensive\nspecifications on adversarially OOD inputs. Namely, we posit the Robustness\nfrom Inference Compute Hypothesis (RICH): inference-compute defenses profit as\nthe model's training data better reflects the attacked data's components. We\nempirically support this hypothesis across vision language model and attack\ntypes, finding robustness gains from test-time compute if specification\nfollowing on OOD data is unlocked by compositional generalization, while RL\nfinetuning and protracted reasoning are not critical. For example, increasing\nemphasis on defensive specifications via prompting lowers the success rate of\ngradient-based multimodal attacks on VLMs robustified by adversarial\npretraining, but this same intervention provides no such benefit to\nnot-robustified models. This correlation of inference-compute's robustness\nbenefit with base model robustness is the rich-get-richer dynamic of the RICH:\nattacked data components are more ID for robustified models, aiding\ncompositional generalization to OOD data.

Extracting\nthese internal models through access to a DNN is conceptually similar to\nextracting a secret key via oracle access to a block cipher. Consequently,\ncryptanalytic techniques, particularly differential-like attacks, have been\nactively explored recently. ReLU-based DNNs are the most commonly and widely\ndeployed architectures. While early works (e.g., Crypto 2020, Eurocrypt 2024)\nassume access to exact output logits, which are usually invisible, more recent\nworks (e.g., Asiacrypt 2024, Eurocrypt 2025) focus on the hard-label setting,\nwhere only the final classification result (e.g., \"dog\" or \"car\") is available\nto the attacker. Notably, Carlini et al. (Eurocrypt 2025) demonstrated that\nmodel extraction is feasible in polynomial time even under this restricted\nsetting.\n  In this paper, we first show that the assumptions underlying their attack\nbecome increasingly unrealistic as the attack-target depth grows. In practice,\nsatisfying these assumptions requires an exponential number of queries with\nrespect to the attack depth, implying that the attack does not always run in\npolynomial time. To address this critical limitation, we propose a novel attack\nmethod called CrossLayer Extraction. Instead of directly extracting the secret\nparameters (e.g., weights and biases) of a specific neuron, which incurs\nexponential cost, we exploit neuron interactions across layers to extract this\ninformation from deeper layers.

      "summary": "A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing\nmore generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are\nrepresented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced\nas a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can\nperform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether\nthis architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot\nsuper-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on\nhigher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we\npropose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution\ntraining protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust\nmulti-resolution generalization.",

Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout\nwith on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or\noptimizations during inference.

      "summary": "Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by\nsearching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system\nbehavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.\nHowever, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical\npriors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic\nexpressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose\na structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages\ntrained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured\nphysical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on\nthe outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural\ninformation to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of\nexpression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that\nquantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical\nresidual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover\noperations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high\nphysical or structural significance while selectively modifying less\ninformative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics\nresiduals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the\ngoverning equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.\nExperiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves\nconvergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability\ncompared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for\nphysics-grounded symbolic discovery.",

However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict\nits widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In\ncontrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely\navailable but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to\ntranslate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.\n  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to\nestimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two\ncomplementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a\nCGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet\npath that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two\npaths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we\ndevelop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG\nsampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.\n  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net\nachieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias.

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become a strong recipe for training\nreasoning LLMs that produce long chains of thought (LongCoT). Yet the standard\nRL \"thinking environment\", where the state is the prompt plus all prior\nreasoning tokens, makes the state unbounded and forces attention-based policies\nto pay quadratic compute as thoughts lengthen. We revisit the environment\nitself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances\nreasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking\nlength from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear\ncompute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL\nenvironment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each\nchunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the\ncontext and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the\npolicy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient\nfor seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this\nenvironment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up\nto 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.\nWith test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.\nThe effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K\naverage thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.\nAnalysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)\noften sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing\npositive samples that make RL effective at scale.

      "title": "Temporal Prompting Matters: Rethinking Referring Video Object\n  Segmentation",
      "summary": "Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object\nreferred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require\nend-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be\ncomputation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS\nproblem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing\nfoundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,\nvideo, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and\nSelection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while\nleaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt\nimage-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object\nsegmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to\nproduce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While\nhigh-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily\nidentified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt\nPreference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.\nBy taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,\nwe would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,\nenabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.\nExperiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet\nframework.",

      "title": "Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision: Going Beyond Classical Algorithms",
      "summary": "Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the\nintersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and\nquantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are\nprocessed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages\nquantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.\nnon-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot\nfind a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,\nquantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time\nscalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can\nalso become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural\nnetworks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new\nalgorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and\nunveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.\nThis survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic\nreview of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference\nfor the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,\nscientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise\nthemselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its\nspecifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware\nand QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.\ngate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the\noperational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,\nprogram and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing\nquantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to\npublishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social\nimplications.",

      "summary": "This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model\nbased on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,\nflying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative\ndepth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive\nperformance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent\nspace, which inevitably introduces \\textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.\nOur model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation\nin the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high\ncomplexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel\ndesigns: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which\nincorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to\nprompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency\nwhile enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that\nprogressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and\naccuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published\ngenerative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all\nother models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.",

      "summary": "Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture\nfine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation\nperformance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting\nin a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.\nExisting world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view\nfirst frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views\nalone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with\ngeometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme\nviewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first\n4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.\nWristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and\nincorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate\ngeometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,\nwhich employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent\nwrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,\nCalvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with\nsuperior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the\naverage task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the\nanchor-wrist view gap.",

      "summary": "Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model\nmulti-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How\ndo these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate\nMATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance\nmask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that\nformalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via\nvideo-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture\ninstances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video\nattention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We\nfind both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization\nthat aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask\ntracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.\nWe further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware\nvideo generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and\nsemantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations\nvalidate our design choices.

      "summary": "Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity\nverification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various\ntransformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and\nadversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we\nintroduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible\nimage watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden\nconvolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency\ndomain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed\nby wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform\napproximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.\nIn the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse\nattacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,\nensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder\nleverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark\npattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We\nevaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,\ncapacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed\nSpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models.

      "summary": "Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients\nwith Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results\nfor automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application\nremains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation\nModels (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if\nthey can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we\nsystematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches\nfor this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal\nimages--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different\ntraining regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and\nOCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do\nnot consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an\nEfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and\nprecision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing\npromising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive\nzero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted\nappropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for\nfine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,\nsuggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce\nenvironments.",

Existing solutions, such as\nfine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic\nprompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis\nand refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness.\nMeanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or\nsample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability.

Diffusion models have\nrecently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex\ndata distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,\nrecent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose\nEigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum\nof the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that\nposterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,\nleading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear\nspectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior\ncovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for\nOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace\niteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward\nevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,\nwith up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline.

      "summary": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,\nbut its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with\nfine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL\nmodels through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices\nimprove transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically\ntested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across\nseven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:\nViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and\n1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The\nprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2\nachieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to\n512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and\nImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across\ninitializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16.

Resolution-related gains\nwere most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In\nchest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the\nbenefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical\nupper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest\nperformance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,\nthese findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for\nchest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting\nsubtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care\nsettings.",

To\nachieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset\nand incorporate an informative condition signal.

To\nmaintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view\nhuman-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference\nvideo, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a\nrobust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates\nthe artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation.

      "summary": "Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable\npotential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot\nperformance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data\nregimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this\nwork, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot\nadaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten\nremote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used\nfew-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying\nbackbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance\ncan exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some\nRSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The\nvariability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing\nmethods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for\nfew-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a\nreproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically\nevaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

      "summary": "Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new\nstandards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains\nchallenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical\nimages feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape\nor texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs\noperate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,\nmaking it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To\naddress this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for\nGraph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding\nto each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features\nand relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer\nmodule and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning\nmechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this\napproach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our\ngenerated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream\nsegmentation tasks.

      "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,\nit requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data\nprivacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm\nthat overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when\ndealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This\nstudy simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity\nnormalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of\nheterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for\nbrain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of\nthe MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training\nand inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to\ninconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of\n92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These\nresults indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing\nmodels without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical\napplications.

      "summary": "Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical\nimage segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped\nvariants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive\nbenchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely\nbecause of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of\nefficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We\nprovide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to\nreproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,\nU-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a\nfoundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the\nnext decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

One key challenge in\nlong video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear\nin different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior\nworks have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer\nfrom limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits\ntheir overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we\nbuild upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the\ninherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the\nID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new\nbenchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights\nthat the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)\nenhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of\ninformation of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a\nnovel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning\nEffectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption\nquality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision\nof ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%\nto 80% compared to baseline.

Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by\nreorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby\nimproving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of\npre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To\novercome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive\nframework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the\ncore of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which\ndecouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic\ninformation and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the\nquantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly\nenhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a\nSemantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context\nEnhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the\nsemantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window\nto enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we\nintroduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that\ndynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance\nto the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,\nimproving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for\nautoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet.

In this\npaper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.\nThe main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how\nimportant is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most\ncritical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.\nThese exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the\noptimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity\nand ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current\nchange detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in\nthe subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the\npositive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative\nmethods.",

      "summary": "LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile\nrobots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on\nresource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often\nface a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse\nconvolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of\nneighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but\nlose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,\nmany recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve\nperformance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing\nphase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded\nplatforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing\nmethodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design\nthe Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture\nrepresentations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a\nmulti-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple\nabstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing\naccuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that\nHARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all\nstate-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is\ncomparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\\times$ faster.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnovel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)\nwhich explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging\nthe discrepancies between predicted and actual information.

In\nthis context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on\nexisting low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy.

      "summary": "Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting\nreliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient\nsequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and\nlack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address\nthese issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware\nState-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution\n(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from\nhigh-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.\nMDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient\nfeatures and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive\nexperiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer\nparameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the\neffectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail\nenhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.",

Instruction-based editing relies\nsolely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing\ndetails, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven\ngeneration is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking\nbroader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel\ntasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support\nboth text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete\nand abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We\nintroduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model\nframework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)\nusing a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and\nconcrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training\ndata using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the\nextraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based\nediting. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index\nencoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish\nimages and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training\nwith the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex\ninstructions.

Existing methods typically\nemploy tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large\nlanguage models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic\nexpressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To\naddress this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a\ncontinuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and\nunderstanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional\nfeatures, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile\nthese competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture\ninvolving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.\nBuilt on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual\nrepresentations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single\nautoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and\ngeneration as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly\nsupports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,\ngeneration and editing.

      "title": "Improving Artifact Robustness for CT Deep Learning Models Without\n  Labeled Artifact Images via Domain Adaptation",
      "summary": "Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training\ndistribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation\ncan effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring\nexpensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for\ndeployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.",

      "title": "Through the Perspective of LiDAR: A Feature-Enriched and\n  Uncertainty-Aware Annotation Pipeline for Terrestrial Point Cloud\n  Segmentation",
      "summary": "Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point\nclouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,\nuncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature\nenrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling\neffort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D\nspherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an\nensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty\nmaps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are\nback-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a\nthree-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and\ncompact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this\npipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove\nforests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address\ntwo key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which\nfeatures matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12\nannotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact\nnine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean\nIntersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm\nthe generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset\ntests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.\n  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation\npipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)\nempirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling\nscalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological\nmonitoring and beyond.

      "title": "HSNet: Heterogeneous Subgraph Network for Single Image Super-resolution",
      "summary": "Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly\nthose based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural\ninflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational\nadaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational\ncomplexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the\nHeterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently\nleverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively\nbalancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will\nbe made publicly available.",

      "title": "Cluster Paths: Navigating Interpretability in Neural Networks",
      "summary": "While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision\ntasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted\ntrust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a\npost-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers\nand represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these\ncluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),\nweighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness\n(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a\nspurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts\nand collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,\nthey achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on\nImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a\nlarge language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster\npaths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably\nflagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident\npredictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,\ntextures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that\ncluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and\nhuman-readable explanations.",

      "summary": "Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified\nunderstanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust\nimage generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often\nrely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,\nleading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,\nor architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework\nthat explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for\nefficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the\nhigh-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a\nlower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual\ninformation. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent\nspace, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,\na dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.\nWe find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than\ncommonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE\nlatents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image\ngeneration performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from\n11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding\ncapabilities.",

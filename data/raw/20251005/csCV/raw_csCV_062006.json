      "title": "Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject\n  Fidelity",
      "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with\nmulti-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity\nentanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical\nframework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling\ndynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through\nstochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as\ncontrol over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic\nalgorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base\nvelocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight\nfine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal\nwhile preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior\nattention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion\ncorrespondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed\nfor multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and\nStable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject\nalignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs\nefficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited\nprompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal\nControl for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art\nmulti-subject fidelity across models.",

      "summary": "3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As\nthese methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes\ncritical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and\npropose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically\ninjects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly\nvisible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.\nAdditionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view\nconsistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based\nevaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling\nobjective benchmarking for future research.

To this end, we make\nthe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each\nphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well\nas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs).

      "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often\nfail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions\nthan those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable\nDiffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly\nimproved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and\nFlux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by\n10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average.

EqM discards the\nnon-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and\nflow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an\nimplicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an\noptimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are\nobtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step\nsizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation\nperformance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on\nImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and\nsample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework\nthat naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD\ndetection, and image composition.

      "summary": "We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete\ndiffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements\nwithout retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved\nremarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous\nGaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework\nfor jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond\nunification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and\nprincipled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited\nfor posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion\nposterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields\nsparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs\nsamplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked\ndiffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized\nexpectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and\nanchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear\nand nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method\ngenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We\npropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion\nsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,\nKineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual\nconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support\nfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena.

      "summary": "Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving\nunprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model.

We propose $\\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training\nframework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using\nfine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)\nwithin a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided\n$\\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global\n$\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we\nintroduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via\nmulti-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,\nand a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned\nwith TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which\nconvexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to\niteratively refine pseudo-labels.

Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we\nshow that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization\nacross viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT,\nDiffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic\nviewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and\nManiSkill that pair \"fixed\" and \"randomized\" scene variants, decoupling\nbackground cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without\nextrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in\nfixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera\nplacement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields\nrobust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,\nand code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .",

      "summary": "Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision\ntechnology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.\nDespite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving\naccurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and\ncomputationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject\nvariability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core\nsemantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we\npropose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:\nAutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter\nis trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to\nemulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we\npretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully\nconnected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This\nenables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject\non lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.",

      "summary": "Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for\ncapturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.\nAccurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential\nfor telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical\nbenchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with\ninertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a\ntotal of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both\ncommodity video cameras and five IMUs.

Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks\n(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA\nBodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using\nOpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17\nkeypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,\nachieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\\deg \\pm 4.80\\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\\deg\n\\pm 4.18\\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \\pm 0.15$)\nand the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \\pm 0.28$).

      "summary": "Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a\nvariety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the\n\"needle in a haystack\" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced\nfrom raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions\nalleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing\ntoken count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal\ndynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In\nthis work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and\ndemonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,\nwhich are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To\nmaintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token\nfootprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically\nbalances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count\nper video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our\ntraining-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and\n10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively.

      "summary": "Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target\nregion, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,\nare insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image\nmanifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on\nDragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and\nregion-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image\nediting.

The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap\nby showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in\nstructured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear\npractical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning\n(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To\naddress this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that\nintroduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,\nenabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding\nskills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to\nimprove both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.\nRewardMap incorporates two key designs.

Second, we propose a multi-stage RL\nscheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning\ntasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

Directly projecting 2D\nfeatures into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing\ngeometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale\nannotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant\nsegmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with\n3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the\n2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated\nfeatures. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small\nStudent Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using\ngeometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model.

Nevertheless, these findings\nare indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations\nthemselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features\nfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.\nThis leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual\ninformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,\nand whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful\nsubspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages\nthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the\nvisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first\nuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent\nsubspace from neural populations.

We validate MIG-Vis on\nmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of\ntwo macaques.

Yet, existing prompts are\noften overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions\nor action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We\npropose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages\naction-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning\nfrom frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent\ngroups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates\nfine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative\nvisual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that\nASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free\nmethods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces\ntowards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM\nbackbones.

This study\nbridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract\nurban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which\nproduces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this\npivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to\nhandle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The\nfirst pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that\nidentifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data\naugmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output\nof the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces\nfalse positives.

      "summary": "Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges\nwith view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with\nhandling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose\n4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first\nintroduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal\nconsistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from\nthe initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures\nduring editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module\nthat enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while\njointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the\nconsistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,\nwhich identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.\nBeyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective\n4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent\nunderstanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic\nediting operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our\nframework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a\nlogical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user\ncommands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,\nour approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our\ncode will be made available upon acceptance.",

The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in\nagricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,\ntimeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional\nabsolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose\nthe 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI).

This framework supports\ntrustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through\nmulti-objective optimization.

Additionally, the \"Pre-Mapping Mechanism\" encodes\nprocess data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.\nExperiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than\nbaseline models.

However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect\nrepresentations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which\nlimits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a\nunified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and\ndiverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),\nderived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly\nwith LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's\noutputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior\nmethods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically\nexpands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation\namong similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by\nrandomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust\nper-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual\nperception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM\nmodels.

This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the\nnatural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for\nanomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in\nan image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class\ndetection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer\nparameters than prior methods.

We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance\nNetwork (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and\nreliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human\nannotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image\nintuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,\nmaking the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to\nalign its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry\ndiagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and\nmedical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological\nimages. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior\naccuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.\nThis reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in\nautomated diagnostic tools.",

Evaluations on\nlarge-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves\nup to $2\\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art\nbaselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to\nscenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.",

      "summary": "Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of\nmachine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a\ncompact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations\nare often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the\nmodel's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a\nnovel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic\nFeature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and\nremoves misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the\nmost relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an\nunsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it\nbroadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted\non image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS\nachieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various\ntasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal\nincrease in the computational cost.",

      "summary": "Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet\nexisting coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are\nconstrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we\nintroduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven\nalternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from\n3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant\nexpression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively\ndisentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode\nthese features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a\nshared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial\ndeformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures\nmore precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.\nWe evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level\npsychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression\ndetection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned\ntokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and\nstrong image and video representation learning models such as Masked\nAutoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider\nvariety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and\neffective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing\napplications.",

This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias\nto the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize\nthese visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that\noptimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when\ndomain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require\nmodifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused\nacross different domains.\n  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M\ntrainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art\nparameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its\nparameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans\nand FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%\nof their trainable parameters.

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion\nmodels, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for\nhigh-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger\ngenerative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods.

We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where\neach timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a\nconsistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By\nreconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns\ntemporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance\nmodel performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation\nand introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior\nperformance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based\nmethods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models.

      "summary": "While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation\nfrom visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with\nloose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works\naddress this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from\nlimited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we\npresent MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view\nvideos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as\nphotorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics\nmodeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which\nwe carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact\nwith the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and\na novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme\nwith our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with\nquasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic\nanimations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)\ndynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and\nefficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar\ngeneralizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not\nachievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation\ngeneralizability.

To resolve this ambiguity,\nprior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or\nlearned models that constrain the solution space.

In this work,\nwe propose \\textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel\nclass of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in\nthe image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection\nof the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two\nkey advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the\nnull-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information\northogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing\nprocess. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,\ncompatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to\nconventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on\nconvergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.\nEmpirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors\nconsistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse\nproblems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed\ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,\nunrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.",

However, constructing\nsuch models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous\nembeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality\nimages but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive\napproaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but\noften face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In\nthis work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments\npre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a\nMixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and\ngeneration within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve\nvisual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete\nrepresentation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel\ntokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual\ndetails with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves\ncompetitive or superior results in both understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time\ncompared to prior unified MLLMs.",

      "summary": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness\nfor aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.\nAlthough Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its\ncomputational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its\napplications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.\nThe precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.\nIn practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked\ninformation, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise\ncomparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective\nframework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with\nlistwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list\nof images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the\nPlackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire\nranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked\nalternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO\nacross various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and\npersonalized preference alignment.

This is particularly challenging in\nhistopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To\naddress this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework\ndesigned to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our\nmethod leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic\ndropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency\nacross these varied outputs.

A key\nchallenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological\nfeatures across the predictions in the absence of ground truth.

      "summary": "Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it\nremains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity\nstructure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture\nhuman-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this\nstructure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap\nby fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our\nnovel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning\npairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find\nthat human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective\nattributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the\npretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video\nmodels' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning\nshapes video representations toward human social perception.",

      "summary": "While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic\naneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,\nincluding nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce\ncontrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating\nsynthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a\nmulti-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs\nsegmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared\nsemantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep\nlearning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while\nsimultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach\nintegrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,\nenabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical\nsegmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires\nno initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder\nand decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training\nstrategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common\nconstraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of\n264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task\nand multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61\ndB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,\nit improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus\nDice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to\nmore accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm\nfrom 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to\nnnU-Net.

Towards addressing\nthis, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes\ninternet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of\ndirectly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a\nvisual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware\nnavigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these\nvisual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows\nnatural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors.

      "summary": "The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is\ncrucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of\neffective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of\nstruggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to\ndetermining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing\nmanipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In\nthis work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68\nhours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle\nsegments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped\ninto four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and\nshuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,\nparticipants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of\nskill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action\nlocalization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle\nsegments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal\nAction Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even\nwhen evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall\naverage mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across\nactivities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various\nskill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in\nstruggle detection.

In particular,\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy\nand perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending\nthese advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing\nsubtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.",

      "summary": "Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive\npersonal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These\nprivacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization\nmethods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure\nscheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person\nauthentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized\nimages but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties\ncan reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the\nfirst secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion\nmodel. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces\nrepresentation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant\nfeatures, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality\nimages. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our\napproach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct\nsecret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces\nthat are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other\nprevious work.",

      "summary": "Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based\non deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose\nsignificant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to\nenhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these\nmethods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to\ndefend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely\nregarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.\nThrough extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial\ntraining does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,\nhyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.\nSpecifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of\nadversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic\ninformation. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and\npropose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By\nincreasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial\nsmoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral\nimages. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by\n21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign\naccuracy by 2.68%.",

However, existing\napproaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single\nscalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable\nfeedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified\nmulti-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across\nfour complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,\nand overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in\nthe form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and\ncan be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by\nthe diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning\ncapability of ImageDoctor by introducing a \"look-think-predict\" paradigm, where\nthe model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and\nfinally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a\nvision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised\nfine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong\nalignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its\neffectiveness as an evaluation metric.

To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an\nuncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations\nacross all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each\ngenerated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the\nsignal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance\nand visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce\nStep Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG.

To break\nthese limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an\nautoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm.

While\nseveral deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark\nlocalization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input\nrepresentations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a\nfully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical\nlandmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse\nalignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of\nlandmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.\nTrained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net\nachieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant\nanatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to\nintra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further\nevaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise\nerror of 0.41\\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\\,mm. Compared to existing\nmethods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh\nquality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy\nacross most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets\nand facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and\nstructural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for\nhigh-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical\nworkflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via\nCellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\\%$ lower than\nthe prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a\nsingle cell type.

      "summary": "Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,\ncausing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering\nhigh-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the\nconventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D\nreports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,\nwe propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention\nmechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the\nextraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as\nwell as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We\nintroduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize\ncross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task\nfine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps\n(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,\ninterpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D\n(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed\nCross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two\naxes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification\nby capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating\ninformation from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on\ntwo large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and\nconvolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is\ncomputationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold\ncompared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic\nperformance and comparable GFLOPS.",

      "summary": "State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a\ncentral role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as\nTransformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,\ntheir quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for\nlong sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied\non recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such\napproaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of\nparallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like\nMamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state\ntransitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while\nmaintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,\nMamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its\ncausal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for\nspatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient\ntemporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an\nalignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame\nwithin the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back\nafterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective\nredistribution of aggregated information across all frames.

      "summary": "Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are\nincreasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate\nconsistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This\nraises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,\nmight they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose\nmultimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the\npotential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically\nlack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we\nstrive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred\ninto Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a\ngenerative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting\nlatents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of\nmodels, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that\ngenerative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding\nthat show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing\nvariant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method\nsignificantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image\nmodels to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of\nvisual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and\nproprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We\nattribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization\nfrom video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model\ndesigns to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study\ncan pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world\nmodels and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.",

      "summary": "Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ\npre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality\nimage either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is\nslow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,\nwhich is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches\ntrain ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,\nwhich often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering\nfrom the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual\nautoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong\nT2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the\nbitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we\nintroduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive\nModeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation\nnetwork is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary\nscales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive\nfine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without\ncompromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual\nresults over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference\nspeed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality\nof input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:\nhttps://github.com/Xiangtaokong/NSARM",

However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:\nmaintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic\nvariations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield\nmisaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness\nin reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel\nevaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground\ntruth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs\nfrom prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By\ndirectly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies\nthat signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing\nrobustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing\nevaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic\nevaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,\nground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I\nmodels and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical\nconstructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and\nDALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,\nrespectively.

      "summary": "Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but\nfalter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs\nsuffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.\nDirectly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality\n(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to\nunnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel\nframework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We\nfirst learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,\nless-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using\na frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information\ntheory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information\nBottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our\nprojector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a\nlow-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our\nframework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,\nand supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models\nwithout need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation\nregimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.",

Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a\npromising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and\nfacial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements\nof the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and\nunbiased data source.

This work examines how subsets of EEG\nchannels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion\nprediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped\nEEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data\ninto scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion\nclassification.

Motion correction\nis essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based\nmethods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness\nand scalability.\n  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction\npipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot\nestimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal\ncomponent analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion\nseries and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton\ndensity-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data\nfrom 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via\ntemporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously\npublished registration-based method.\n  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal\nsmoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =\n0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to\nbefore registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed\nreduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)\nml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g).

However, most existing Vision-Language-Action\nmodels (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they\nrely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this\npaper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the\nhistorical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment\ntokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their\nrepresentations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them\nto better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight\nmemory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into\nmemory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through\nempirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a\nstate-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating\nsignificant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.\nIn particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of\n76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline\nperformance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from\n64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on\nLIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation\nbenchmarks.",

However, event cameras\nlack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection\nparticularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically\ntrained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel\nobjects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.\nVision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in\nRGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it\nineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed\nfor event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge\ndistillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve\nopen-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP\ndirectly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,\nguiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual\nrepresentations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student\nnetwork learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while\ninheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge.

Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal\ncomponent analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,\nboth strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow\nseparation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep\nlearning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly\nseparating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised\nfilters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and\nin-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by\nalgorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this\nend, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that\npreserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning\nlabels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least\nsquares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.\nA sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability\nto capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter\nthat is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following\nframes. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo\ndatasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the\nSVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.\nParticularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of\nthe power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated\nthrough ablation studies.",

Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent\n(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform\nthe learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we\nfind that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without\ncompromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT",

      "summary": "Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which\nseriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been\nwidely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.\nHowever, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of\ntraining samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,\nleaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly\nsupervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and\nmulti-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate\npixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training\nframework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale\nscene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are\nthen obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness\nmap based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large\ncloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on\nthe differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales\nand combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.\nTwo datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1\nmultispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection\nmethods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method\nshows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential\nof the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage\nconditions.",

While\nconcept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing\napproaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable\nDiffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to\nnext-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we\npresent ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess\nthe robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I\nframework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept\nerasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon\nknown as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple\nyet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its\ncore, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively\nreactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further\nreinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept\nreactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a\nconsistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves\nunrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the\neffectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a\nreliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies\nin rectified flow transformers.",

In this\nwork, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables\nefficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to\nsupport interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary\nPosition Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to\nalign generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables\nfine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of\nfixed-position paradigms in prior work.

Experimentally, we build\ncomprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to\nassess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors.

      "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task\nlearning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task\npretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient\nknowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning\n(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts\n(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are\nassigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.\nThis design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,\nand cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing\nthe number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling\nmore effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive\nexperiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,\ndemonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse\nconfigurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.",

To demonstrate\nthat exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new\nvision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images\nannotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection\napproach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets\nwith instance level masks.

      "summary": "Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote\nsensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely\nhampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily\noccluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing\nconventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained\nfeatures and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these\nobstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework\nmeticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building\nupon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of\ninnovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to\nensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved\nthroughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature\nfusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature\nrepresentation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ\nVarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus\non high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our\nchallenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that\nForestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked\nimprovements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming\nestablished baseline models.",

Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in\na coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose\nuncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are\nrestricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D\nreconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a\ncoarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic\nmodeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model\nthat samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent\nDiffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a\njoint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned\nlatent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships\nand robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the\ndifficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy\nthrough sequential refinement.

However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive\ncapabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding\nbox, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their\nhuman-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual\ninteractions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of\nuser intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn\nentity-level information within images to complement their global\nrepresentations for conventional embedding tasks.

      "summary": "Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular\nregions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for\nsearching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method\nconsisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a\nuser-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose\nencoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,\nsummed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular\nregions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D\noffset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to\ncubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even\nif they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric\nwere compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor\nImage Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the\nproposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional\ncomputation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search\nmetrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were\nhigher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional\nmetric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes.\nConclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise\nsearch of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis\nusing MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D\nfull search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned\nrectangular tumor regions.",

      "summary": "Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically\ninvolve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.\nHowever, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed\nImage Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical\nlimitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not\npreserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high\nfrequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy\nimages. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling\nnetwork (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.\nFirst, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for\nnoisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present\na parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of\nconvolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,\nwithout changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral\nSeparation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates\nnoise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and\nlow-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details\nof images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify\nthe effectiveness of SCNet.",

      "summary": "Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating\nhigh-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over\nextended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short\nin subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing\nprompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and\ninteractions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose\nBindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video\nscenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with\nheterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual\nsubjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal\nlarge language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and\ndisentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden\nstates that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity\nsubject-consistent video generation.

      "summary": "Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of\ndeep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random\ntransformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the\nmodel's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a\nresult, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for\nsuch dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's\nevolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To\naddress this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that\nperforms on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's\nevolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each\nsample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update\ndirection and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.\nSamples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are\naugmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive\nmilder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.\nOur method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy\ntuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a\nplug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model\narchitectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\\% on\nfine-grained tasks and +4.3\\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the\nmethod's effectiveness and practicality.",

      "summary": "Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of\ndiffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and\nrobustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt\nrefinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach\nthat applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,\nthereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement\nlearning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL\nframework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.\nRather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language\nmodel (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on\nintermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a\nstructural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the\nflexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that\nPromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes\nseamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing\nalignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.",

      "summary": "Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)\nplanning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent\nhealthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation\nremains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image\nSegmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI\ntechniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite\nwidespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically\ncritical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool\nspecifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT\nworkflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction\nmethods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and\nscribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation\ninvolving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025\nMeningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated\nsubstantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice\nsimilarity coefficients of up to 77.6\\% and Intersection over Union scores of\n64.8\\%.

This paper presents a comparative analysis\nbetween a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a\nstate-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,\nacross two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST\nbenchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our\nexperiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in\nboth cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we\ndemonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:\ndecision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a\nvalidation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across\nboth datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM\nto achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's\n0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the\nF1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's\n0.7834.

      "title": "Paper2Video: Automatic Video Generation from Scientific Papers",
      "summary": "Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research\ncommunication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often\nrequiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10\nminutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and\ncode are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.",

      "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing\nclips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent\nchain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state\ntransitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and\nmultimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and\nfuture prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,\na novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual\nreasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,\nVChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to\ngenerate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used\nto guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only\nat these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal\noverhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,\nmulti-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of\ngenerated videos.",

      "title": "Character Mixing for Video Generation",
      "summary": "Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where\ncharacters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character\ninteraction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve\neach character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context\ninteraction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and\nbecause mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters\nappear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these\nissues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and\nbehavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation\n(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style\ndata. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously\nuncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a\ncurated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show\nclear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and\nrobustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative\nstorytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:\nhttps://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/.",

      "summary": "While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically\npleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured\nvisuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand\ncomposition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual\nfidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic\ninvestigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,\nand an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3\nmillion high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing\nprograms and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on\nit, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a\nlightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage\ntraining curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,\nand reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at\ninference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for\ngeneration and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an\naccompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\\&A\nprotocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models\nreveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.\nOur model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning\nyields consistent gains across diverse architectures.

      "summary": "Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects\nis essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high\nstandards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular\nClassifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image\nclassification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone\nfor localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture\nglobal semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is\nincorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,\nenriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is\nthe neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that\ndynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by\nbiological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data\ncomplexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,\nwe validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),\nwhich involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental\nresults across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms\ntraditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability.

      "summary": "Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.\nDuring image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast\nchange and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to\nassess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and\nnoise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and\nproperties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this\npaper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for\ncontrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we\naim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual\nreference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference\n(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of\ncontrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can\nselect the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content\nand distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation\nis performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the\ncontrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation\nof the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions\n(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the\nproposed method.",

      "summary": "Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that\nestablishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent\nregions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized\nfeatures, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater\nrobustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this\npaper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle\nwide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme\nviewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of\nthese 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180\ndegree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and\nlocal feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++\nand Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on\nrelevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal\nnavigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/",

      "summary": "Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer\nvision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,\nlong-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of\nVideo-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders\nwith powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that\ntransforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated\nreasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.\nThis survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training\nmethodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)\nfrom verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced\ninference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the\nroles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,\naddressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal\ngrounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through\nsystematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design\nprinciples, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open\nchallenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We\nfurther curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate\nrigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness.

      "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition\ncharacterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement\ndisorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,\nyet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this\nstudy, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral\nand wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology\nleverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and\nattention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against\noverfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave\ncategories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number\nof images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing\npre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble\nvoting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating\npredictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy\nrates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are\n90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions\nthrough ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%.

We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action\nlabels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our\nresults show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution\nclassification performance to other LL-PDL approaches.

      "summary": "Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can\nbe fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance\nand efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation\ncost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to\ndistribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property\nrights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally\nredistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the\ndevelopment of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance\ntoday, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed\ncopy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose\nan approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by\nfine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small\nencoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal\nrepresentation of a hold-out set of input images.

Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized\nvariational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and\nadversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled\nalternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.\nHowever, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,\nas well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for\nimproved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components\nand GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the\ndiffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder.

In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from\n$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation\nquality of DiTs with $3.8\\times$ faster sampling.

      "summary": "Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique\n(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast\ncancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be\nmissing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression\nartifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view\ntranslation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike\nnatural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large\nnon-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which\nobscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and\nImplicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view\ntranslation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address\ncross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware\ncross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that\nanatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions\nacross views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise\ncorrelations while suppressing distant mismatches.

      "summary": "The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the\navailability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is\nnotoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a\nstrategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative\ndata, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.\nUnsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the\nannotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing\nUAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches\ntypically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance\nestimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data\nbut also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the\nfull data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear\nselection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the\nNatural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes\nhow sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature\nLearning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to\nmodel performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful\nReconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our\ncomprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all\nestablished UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL\nmethods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative\nvisualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,\nenhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.",

      "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to\nscalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex\ntasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific\nconstraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and\nregional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,\nwe introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed\nMoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN\nleverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated\nto distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise\nmodeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating\nmechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)\nfeatures (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to\ninterstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently\nsuperior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of\n0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC\n0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe\nmodels achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)\nand aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous\npatient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and\nclinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach\nreadily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.",

      "summary": "Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image\nclassification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex\ndata. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that\nrepresent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies\nare frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained\nclassification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware\nHierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and\nrelationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a\ndeep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class\ngranularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which\nguide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a\nself-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus\nmechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different\nhierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to\neffectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification\ntask. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with\ndifferent degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct\nbackbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental\nresults show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network\nlearning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing\nimage classification tasks.",

A critical\nbarrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift\" caused by variable illumination.\nTo overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant\nSpectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns\nillumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the\nsystem's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct\nillumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable\nnatural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the\ncomplete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$\n(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction\ngeneralization by over 20% compared to the baselines.

      "summary": "Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research\nstudies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable\nexperimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples\nand must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct\nprocessing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with\nvariable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward\nimplementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when\nevaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for\nwell-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal\ndomain.\n  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based\nIQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability\nand fast prediction. Our method, named $\\mathrm{\\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by\nprevious studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for\nIQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same\narchitecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores\nfor optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable\npredictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside\nthe ideal range of standard methods.

Therefore, a\nmultitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs\nwhile maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been\nintroduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a\ndesirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed\nmethod effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:\nearly exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit\nmodel is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary\ncontribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student\nearly-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation\nloss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the\nteacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the\ntrade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant\nreductions in computational complexity without compromising classification\nperformance.

We offer an under-studied perspective by\nexamining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and\nLlama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

      "title": "A Comparative Study of Vision Transformers and CNNs for Few-Shot Rigid\n  Transformation and Fundamental Matrix Estimation",
      "summary": "Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)\nhave reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that\nenable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as\nbackbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image\ndeformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers\ntwo such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images\nand 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important\nproblem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D\nscene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work\nsystematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)\nwith ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data\nsize settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are\noptimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus\nmostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local\nand global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of\nthese models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,\nsimilar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in\nlarge downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the\ninductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing\nthem to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in\ncross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results\nemphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for\nrefinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that\nbalance local and global representations.",

      "summary": "Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art\nin federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess\nhow well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt\nthrough local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development\nwithout sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to\nclassify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the\nmulti-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across\ncenters was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after\nfine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission\nachieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted\nlimitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties\nin hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal\nmodeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.\nConclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for\nevaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight\nthe trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and\nunderscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss\ndesign. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of\nimbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.",

      "summary": "The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent\nyears, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While\ntraditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches\nhave moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary\ntext queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in\ntext-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to\ncapture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs\nsignificant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present\nPG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables\nopen-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive\nonline densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D\nGaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively\nenhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and\ndetailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of\nan anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which\nadaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and\nstages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene\ninformation capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement\nover the previous best performing method.

While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on\naxis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics\nwhen logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and\nperspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end\nsystem designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in\nsports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts\nOriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo\nregardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we\ndeveloped a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,\nfeaturing 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a\nmean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall\nof 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse\nbroadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical\npipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration\nand on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic\nlayer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through\nnatural language queries.

Evaluated on the\nPsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at\nthe run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that\nintegrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,\nand BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our\nfindings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for\npsychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on\nmovement-informed psychological inference.",

      "summary": "As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual\nstudent agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher\ntraining. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely\nunassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering\ntrustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning\ntwo languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five\ntheory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,\ncorresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded\nthrough persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),\nproviding a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we\ndecompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:\nTASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align\nwith classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona\nconsistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in\neducational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on\nthree representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten\npersona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and\nsignificant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,\nand TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and\nresearch value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona\nmodeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark\ncentered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable\nresearch paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework\nto support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and\nhuman-like AI for education.",

Numerous feature fusion techniques\naddress multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global\nand local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract\nstructural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal\nimages. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and\nsparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency\ninteraction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across\nthe spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a\nhigh-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse\nspatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency\nfilter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is\nintroduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses\nlow-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a\nhigh-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.\nIn addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances\nfeature extraction at intermediate layers of the network.

We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI\nviewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs\ninto standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete\nmagnifications) and bounding boxes.

For instance, in animal habitat analysis,\nresearchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings\nemphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,\nexisting approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high\ncomputational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional\nRepresentation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to\narbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics\nof a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive\nwords to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon\nthis insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic\nbasis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature\nspace leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation\nbetter captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized\nfor multiple customized tasks.

To address this issue, we propose\nasynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct\ntimesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising\nprocess.

      "title": "CodeFormer++: Blind Face Restoration Using Deformable Registration and\n  Deep Metric Learning",
      "summary": "Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise\nof generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors\ninto the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail\ngeneration and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from\na trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either\nidentity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we\npresent CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of\ngenerative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.\nWe decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face\nrestoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of\nidentity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key\ncontributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that\nsemantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided\nrestoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of\ngenerated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and\n(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of\ninformative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-\npreserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves\nsuperior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.",

      "title": "Your Vision-Language Model Can't Even Count to 20: Exposing the Failures\n  of VLMs in Compositional Counting",
      "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI\ncommunity, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on\nlarge-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated\nstrong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video\nunderstanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these\nnoteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects\ncorrectly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,\nVLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric\nshapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively\non counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict\nindependent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple\nproperties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.\nOur empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one\nshape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape\ntypes are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a\nfundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important\ndirections for future research.",

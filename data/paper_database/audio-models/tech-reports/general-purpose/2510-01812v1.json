  "title": "SingMOS-Pro: An Comprehensive Benchmark for Singing Quality Assessment",
  "summary": "Singing voice generation progresses rapidly, yet evaluating singing quality\nremains a critical challenge. Human subjective assessment, typically in the\nform of listening tests, is costly and time consuming, while existing objective\nmetrics capture only limited perceptual aspects. In this work, we introduce\nSingMOS-Pro, a dataset for automatic singing quality assessment. Building on\nour preview version SingMOS, which provides only overall ratings, SingMOS-Pro\nexpands annotations of the additional part to include lyrics, melody, and\noverall quality, offering broader coverage and greater diversity. The dataset\ncontains 7,981 singing clips generated by 41 models across 12 datasets,\nspanning from early systems to recent advances. Each clip receives at least\nfive ratings from professional annotators, ensuring reliability and\nconsistency. Furthermore, we explore how to effectively utilize MOS data\nannotated under different standards and benchmark several widely used\nevaluation methods from related tasks on SingMOS-Pro, establishing strong\nbaselines and practical references for future research. The dataset can be\naccessed at https://huggingface.co/datasets/TangRain/SingMOS-Pro.",

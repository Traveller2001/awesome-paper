  "title": "Open ASR Leaderboard: Towards Reproducible and Transparent Multilingual\n  and Long-Form Speech Recognition Evaluation",
  "summary": "Despite rapid progress, ASR evaluation remains saturated with short-form\nEnglish, and efficiency is rarely reported. We present the Open ASR\nLeaderboard, a fully reproducible benchmark and interactive leaderboard\ncomparing 60+ open-source and proprietary systems across 11 datasets, including\ndedicated multilingual and long-form tracks. We standardize text normalization\nand report both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx),\nenabling fair accuracy-efficiency comparisons. For English transcription,\nConformer encoders paired with LLM decoders achieve the best average WER but\nare slower, while CTC and TDT decoders deliver much better RTFx, making them\nattractive for long-form and offline use. Whisper-derived encoders fine-tuned\nfor English improve accuracy but often trade off multilingual coverage. All\ncode and dataset loaders are open-sourced to support transparent, extensible\nevaluation.",

  "tldr_zh": "本文推出开源ASR评测平台，对60余个语音识别系统在11个数据集上进行标准化评估，涵盖多语言和长音频场景。研究发现：Conformer编码器+LLM解码器在英语识别准确率最优但速度较慢，CTC/TDT解码器在效率上更具优势。平台开源所有代码以促进透明可复现的语音识别评测。",

  "title": "BanglaTalk: Towards Real-Time Speech Assistance for Bengali Regional\n  Dialects",
  "summary": "Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring\nimproved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language\nwith a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in\ndeveloping such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use\nand focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the\nfirst real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.\nBanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time\nTransport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address\ndialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,\ndeveloped by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional\ndialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the\nRegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of\n24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low\nbandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both\ncost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and\naccessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.",

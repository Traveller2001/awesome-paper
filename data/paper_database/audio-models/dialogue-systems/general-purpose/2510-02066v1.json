  "title": "Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming Full-Duplex End-to-End Spoken\n  Dialogue Systems",
  "summary": "Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity\ndetection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses\nand turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output\ncontinuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit\nVAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind\ncascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nSCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating\nbetween processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a\nblockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate\ntargets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block.\nExperiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable\nresponses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and\noverlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.",

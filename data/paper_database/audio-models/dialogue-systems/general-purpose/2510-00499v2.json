  "title": "MOSS-Speech: Towards True Speech-to-Speech Models Without Text Guidance",
  "summary": "Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe,\nprocess, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards\nparalinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce\nlatency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates,\ncreating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true\nspeech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates\nspeech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based\nlayer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving\nthe reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech\ncapabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results\nin spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech\nperformance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining\ncompetitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and\ndirect speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive\nand efficient end-to-end speech interaction.",

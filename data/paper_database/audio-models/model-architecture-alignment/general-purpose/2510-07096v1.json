  "title": "Making Machines Sound Sarcastic: LLM-Enhanced and Retrieval-Guided\n  Sarcastic Speech Synthesis",
  "summary": "Sarcasm is a subtle form of non-literal language that poses significant\nchallenges for speech synthesis due to its reliance on nuanced semantic,\ncontextual, and prosodic cues. While existing speech synthesis research has\nfocused primarily on broad emotional categories, sarcasm remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced\nRetrieval-Augmented framework for sarcasm-aware speech synthesis. Our approach\ncombines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture\npragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic\nexemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which\nprovide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within\na VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually\nappropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations,\nyielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and\ndownstream sarcasm detection.",

  "title": "An Attention-Augmented VAE-BiLSTM Framework for Anomaly Detection in\n  12-Lead ECG Signals",
  "summary": "Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for\nidentifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work\npresents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:\nconvolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional\nlong short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention\n(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of\nour knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA\narchitecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG\nsamples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations\nindicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on\nthe public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the\nattention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81\nand a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other\narchitectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated\ninto an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In\naddition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is\nprovided.",

  "title": "Blind Construction of Angular Power Maps in Massive MIMO Networks",
  "summary": "Channel state information (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem in\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks. Radio maps provide a\npromising solution for radio resource management by reducing online CSI\nacquisition. However, conventional approaches for radio map construction\nrequire location-labeled CSI data, which is challenging in practice. This paper\ninvestigates unsupervised angular power map construction based on large\ntimescale CSI data collected in a massive MIMO network without location labels.\nA hidden Markov model (HMM) is built to connect the hidden trajectory of a\nmobile with the CSI evolution of a massive MIMO channel. As a result, the\nmobile location can be estimated, enabling the construction of an angular power\nmap. We show that under uniform rectilinear mobility with Poisson-distributed\nbase stations (BSs), the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for localization error\ncan vanish at any signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), whereas when BSs are confined\nto a limited region, the error remains nonzero even with infinite independent\nmeasurements. Based on reference signal received power (RSRP) data collected in\na real multi-cell massive MIMO network, an average localization error of 18\nmeters can be achieved although measurements are mainly obtained from a single\nserving cell.",

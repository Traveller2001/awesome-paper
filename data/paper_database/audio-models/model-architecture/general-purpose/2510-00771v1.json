  "title": "UniverSR: Unified and Versatile Audio Super-Resolution via Vocoder-Free\n  Flow Matching",
  "summary": "In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution\nthat employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional\ndistribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional\ntwo-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then\nrely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method\ndirectly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform\n(iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design\nnot only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical\nbottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is\nfundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our\nmodel consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse\nupsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and\ngeneral audio datasets.",

  "title": "Bias beyond Borders: Global Inequalities in AI-Generated Music",
  "summary": "While recent years have seen remarkable progress in music generation models,\nresearch on their biases across countries, languages, cultures, and musical\ngenres remains underexplored. This gap is compounded by the lack of datasets\nand benchmarks that capture the global diversity of music. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce GlobalDISCO, a large-scale dataset consisting of 73k\nmusic tracks generated by state-of-the-art commercial generative music models,\nalong with paired links to 93k reference tracks in LAION-DISCO-12M. The dataset\nspans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from\nMusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing\nmusical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our\nevaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with\nreference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we\nfind marked differences in model performance between mainstream and\ngeographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for\nregional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream\nstyles.",

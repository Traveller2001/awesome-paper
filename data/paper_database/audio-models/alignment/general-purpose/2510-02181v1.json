  "title": "EvolveCaptions: Empowering DHH Users Through Real-Time Collaborative\n  Captioning",
  "summary": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often fail to accurately\ntranscribe speech from Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) individuals, especially\nduring real-time conversations. Existing personalization approaches typically\nrequire extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the\nDHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR\nadaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort.\nHearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on\nthese corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts\nfor the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model.\nIn a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced\nWord Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only\nfive minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as\nintuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings\ndemonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more\nequitable communication.",

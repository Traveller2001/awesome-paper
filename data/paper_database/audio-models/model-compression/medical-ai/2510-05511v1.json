  "title": "EEG-Based Acute Pain Classification: Machine Learning Model Comparison\n  and Real-Time Clinical Feasibility",
  "summary": "Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or\nnon-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and\ncognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid\noveruse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring\nbrain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive\ntool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In\nthis study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain\nversus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed\nto laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second\nepoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band\nratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and\npeak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated\nwith leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with\nradial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%\naccuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance\nanalysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing\ncontralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal\ngamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of\nabout 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is\ntechnically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards\nclinical validation.",

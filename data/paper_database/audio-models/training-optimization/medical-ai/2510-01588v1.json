  "title": "Enhancing Noise Robustness of Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring via\n  Contrastive Feature Augmentation",
  "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative\ndisorder. PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling\nself-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale\n(UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients. However, three types\nof noise would occur during measurements: (1) patient-induced measurement\ninaccuracies, (2) environmental noise, and (3) data packet loss during\ntransmission, resulting in higher prediction errors. To address these\nchallenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First,\nthe original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the\ncontinuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs.\nSecond, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron\nencoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are\nconcatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are\nthen fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a\nnovel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and\nextensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise\nrobustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models\nunder different noisy environments.",

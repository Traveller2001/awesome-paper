  "title": "Improving Clinical Dataset Condensation with Mode Connectivity-based\n  Trajectory Surrogates",
  "summary": "Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving\nsynthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,\nsupporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing\ndownstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic\ndata by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those\ntrained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often\nnoisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,\nslow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations\nby replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,\nspecifically quadratic B\\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model\nstates from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide\nnoise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,\naccelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We\ntheoretically justify B\\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD\npaths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,\nyielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.",

  "title": "Shift-Invariant Attribute Scoring for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks via\n  Shapley Value",
  "summary": "For many real-world applications, understanding feature-outcome relationships\nis as crucial as achieving high predictive accuracy. While traditional neural\nnetworks excel at prediction, their black-box nature obscures underlying\nfunctional relationships. Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs) address this by\nemploying learnable spline-based activation functions on edges, enabling\nrecovery of symbolic representations while maintaining competitive performance.\nHowever, KAN's architecture presents unique challenges for network pruning.\nConventional magnitude-based methods become unreliable due to sensitivity to\ninput coordinate shifts. We propose \\textbf{ShapKAN}, a pruning framework using\nShapley value attribution to assess node importance in a shift-invariant\nmanner. Unlike magnitude-based approaches, ShapKAN quantifies each node's\nactual contribution, ensuring consistent importance rankings regardless of\ninput parameterization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that ShapKAN preserves true node importance while enabling\neffective network compression. Our approach improves KAN's interpretability\nadvantages, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

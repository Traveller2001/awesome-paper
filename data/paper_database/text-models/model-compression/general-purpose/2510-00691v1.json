  "title": "Inclusive Easy-to-Read Generation for Individuals with Cognitive\n  Impairments",
  "summary": "Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is\nessential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However,\nmanual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to\nscale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and\ncivic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key\nchallenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing\nlightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we\nintroduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant\nwith European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on\nPLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and\naccessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic\nmetrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a\n36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall\nresults show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to\nout-of-domain texts.",

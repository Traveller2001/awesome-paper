  "title": "The Disparate Impacts of Speculative Decoding",
  "summary": "The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically\nsupported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard\ntechnique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language\nmodels. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the\nlens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the\npaper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly\ndistributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often\nunderrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an\nanalysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the\nfactors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by\nthese insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce\nspeed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs,\nrevealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.",

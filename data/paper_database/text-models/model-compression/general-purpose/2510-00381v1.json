  "title": "Semantic-Driven AI Agent Communications: Challenges and Solutions",
  "summary": "With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are\nshifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new\nparadigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.\nSemantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw\ndata, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains\nconstrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these\nissues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication\nframework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation\ntransmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently\nadapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission\nincorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce\nmodel complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,\nsemantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical\ndecision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust\nmulti-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that\nthe proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,\nwhile the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly\noutperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential\nfor AI agent communication networks.",

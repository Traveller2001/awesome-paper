  "title": "Agent-in-the-Loop: A Data Flywheel for Continuous Improvement in\n  LLM-based Customer Support",
  "summary": "We introduce an Agent-in-the-Loop (AITL) framework that implements a\ncontinuous data flywheel for iteratively improving an LLM-based customer\nsupport system. Unlike standard offline approaches that rely on batch\nannotations, AITL integrates four key types of annotations directly into live\ncustomer operations: (1) pairwise response preferences, (2) agent adoption and\nrationales, (3) knowledge relevance checks, and (4) identification of missing\nknowledge. These feedback signals seamlessly feed back into models' updates,\nreducing retraining cycles from months to weeks. Our production pilot involving\nUS-based customer support agents demonstrated significant improvements in\nretrieval accuracy (+11.7% recall@75, +14.8% precision@8), generation quality\n(+8.4% helpfulness) and agent adoption rates (+4.5%). These results underscore\nthe effectiveness of embedding human feedback loops directly into operational\nworkflows to continuously refine LLM-based customer support system.",

  "title": "Incremental Summarization for Customer Support via Progressive\n  Note-Taking and Agent Feedback",
  "summary": "We introduce an incremental summarization system for customer support agents\nthat intelligently determines when to generate concise bullet notes during\nconversations, reducing agents' context-switching effort and redundant review.\nOur approach combines a fine-tuned Mixtral-8x7B model for continuous note\ngeneration with a DeBERTa-based classifier to filter trivial content. Agent\nedits refine the online notes generation and regularly inform offline model\nretraining, closing the agent edits feedback loop. Deployed in production, our\nsystem achieved a 3% reduction in case handling time compared to bulk\nsummarization (with reductions of up to 9% in highly complex cases), alongside\nhigh agent satisfaction ratings from surveys. These results demonstrate that\nincremental summarization with continuous feedback effectively enhances summary\nquality and agent productivity at scale.",

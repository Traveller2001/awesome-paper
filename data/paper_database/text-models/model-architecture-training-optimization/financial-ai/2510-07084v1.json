  "title": "HTMformer: Hybrid Time and Multivariate Transformer for Time Series\n  Forecasting",
  "summary": "Transformer-based methods have achieved impressive results in time series\nforecasting. However, existing Transformers still exhibit limitations in\nsequence modeling as they tend to overemphasize temporal dependencies. This\nincurs additional computational overhead without yielding corresponding\nperformance gains. We find that the performance of Transformers is highly\ndependent on the embedding method used to learn effective representations. To\naddress this issue, we extract multivariate features to augment the effective\ninformation captured in the embedding layer, yielding multidimensional\nembeddings that convey richer and more meaningful sequence representations.\nThese representations enable Transformer-based forecasters to better understand\nthe series. Specifically, we introduce Hybrid Temporal and Multivariate\nEmbeddings (HTME). The HTME extractor integrates a lightweight temporal feature\nextraction module with a carefully designed multivariate feature extraction\nmodule to provide complementary features, thereby achieving a balance between\nmodel complexity and performance. By combining HTME with the Transformer\narchitecture, we present HTMformer, leveraging the enhanced feature extraction\ncapability of the HTME extractor to build a lightweight forecaster. Experiments\nconducted on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and efficiency.",

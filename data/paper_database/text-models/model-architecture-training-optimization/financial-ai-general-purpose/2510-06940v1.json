  "title": "Revisiting Node Affinity Prediction in Temporal Graphs",
  "summary": "Node affinity prediction is a common task that is widely used in temporal\ngraph learning with applications in social and financial networks, recommender\nsystems, and more. Recent works have addressed this task by adapting\nstate-of-the-art dynamic link property prediction models to node affinity\nprediction. However, simple heuristics, such as Persistent Forecast or Moving\nAverage, outperform these models. In this work, we analyze the challenges in\ntraining current Temporal Graph Neural Networks for node affinity prediction\nand suggest appropriate solutions. Combining the solutions, we develop NAViS -\nNode Affinity prediction model using Virtual State, by exploiting the\nequivalence between heuristics and state space models. While promising,\ntraining NAViS is non-trivial. Therefore, we further introduce a novel loss\nfunction for node affinity prediction. We evaluate NAViS on TGB and show that\nit outperforms the state-of-the-art, including heuristics. Our source code is\navailable at https://github.com/orfeld415/NAVIS",

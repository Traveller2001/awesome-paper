  "title": "REBot: From RAG to CatRAG with Semantic Enrichment and Graph Routing",
  "summary": "Academic regulation advising is essential for helping students interpret and\ncomply with institutional policies, yet building effective systems requires\ndomain specific regulatory resources. To address this challenge, we propose\nREBot, an LLM enhanced advisory chatbot powered by CatRAG, a hybrid retrieval\nreasoning framework that integrates retrieval augmented generation with graph\nbased reasoning. CatRAG unifies dense retrieval and graph reasoning, supported\nby a hierarchical, category labeled knowledge graph enriched with semantic\nfeatures for domain alignment. A lightweight intent classifier routes queries\nto the appropriate retrieval modules, ensuring both factual accuracy and\ncontextual depth. We construct a regulation specific dataset and evaluate REBot\non classification and question answering tasks, achieving state of the art\nperformance with an F1 score of 98.89%. Finally, we implement a web application\nthat demonstrates the practical value of REBot in real world academic advising\nscenarios.",

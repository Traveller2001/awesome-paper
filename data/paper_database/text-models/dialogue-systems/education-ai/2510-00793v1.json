  "title": "AI in data science education: experiences from the classroom",
  "summary": "This study explores the integration of AI, particularly large language models\n(LLMs) like ChatGPT, into educational settings, focusing on the implications\nfor teaching and learning. Through interviews with course coordinators from\ndata science courses at Wageningen University, this research identifies both\nthe benefits and challenges associated with AI in the classroom. While AI tools\ncan streamline tasks and enhance learning, concerns arise regarding students'\noverreliance on these technologies, potentially hindering the development of\nessential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the\nimportance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for\nadapting assessment methods to ensure educational outcomes are met. With\ncareful integration, AI can be a valuable asset in education, provided it is\nused to complement rather than replace fundamental learning processes.",

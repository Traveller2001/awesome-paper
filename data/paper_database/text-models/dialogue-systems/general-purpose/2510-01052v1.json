  "title": "Hybrid Dialogue State Tracking for Persian Chatbots: A Language\n  Model-Based Approach",
  "summary": "Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI\nwith the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading\nit toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and\nmulti-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough,\nsince it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like\nexperiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model\nthat utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for\nslot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST,\nand online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely\ndesigned to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset\nand demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing\nmethods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a\nhybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational\nAI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.",

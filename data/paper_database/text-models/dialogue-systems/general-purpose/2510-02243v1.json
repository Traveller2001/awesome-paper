  "title": "AccurateRAG: A Framework for Building Accurate Retrieval-Augmented\n  Question-Answering Applications",
  "summary": "We introduce AccurateRAG -- a novel framework for constructing\nhigh-performance question-answering applications based on retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG). Our framework offers a pipeline for development efficiency\nwith tools for raw dataset processing, fine-tuning data generation, text\nembedding & LLM fine-tuning, output evaluation, and building RAG systems\nlocally. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms previous\nstrong baselines and obtains new state-of-the-art question-answering\nperformance on benchmark datasets.",

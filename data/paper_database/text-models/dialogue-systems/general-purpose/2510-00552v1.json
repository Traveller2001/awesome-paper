  "title": "Data Quality Challenges in Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
  "summary": "Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to\nenhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,\ncurrent data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static\ndatasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG\nsystems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based\nsystems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading\nIT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively\nderive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG\nsystems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.\nOur findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ\nframeworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are\nconcentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality\nmanagement strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the\nRAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality\nmanagement.",

  "tldr_zh": "本研究针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统开发数据质量维度框架。通过对16位IT服务公司从业者的访谈，识别出覆盖RAG四个处理阶段的15个数据质量维度。研究发现：传统数据质量框架需新增维度以适应RAG场景；新维度集中于前期处理阶段，需前置质量管理策略；数据质量问题会在RAG流程中传递演变，需动态分阶段管理。",

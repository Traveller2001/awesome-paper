  "title": "A Locally Executable AI System for Improving Preoperative Patient\n  Communication: A Multi-Domain Clinical Evaluation",
  "summary": "Patients awaiting invasive procedures often have unanswered pre-procedural\nquestions; however, time-pressured workflows and privacy constraints limit\npersonalized counseling. We present LENOHA (Low Energy, No Hallucination, Leave\nNo One Behind Architecture), a safety-first, local-first system that routes\ninputs with a high-precision sentence-transformer classifier and returns\nverbatim answers from a clinician-curated FAQ for clinical queries, eliminating\nfree-text generation in the clinical path. We evaluated two domains (tooth\nextraction and gastroscopy) using expert-reviewed validation sets\n(n=400/domain) for thresholding and independent test sets (n=200/domain). Among\nthe four encoders, E5-large-instruct (560M) achieved an overall accuracy of\n0.983 (95% CI 0.964-0.991), AUC 0.996, and seven total errors, which were\nstatistically indistinguishable from GPT-4o on this task; Gemini made no errors\non this test set. Energy logging shows that the non-generative clinical path\nconsumes ~1.0 mWh per input versus ~168 mWh per small-talk reply from a local\n8B SLM, a ~170x difference, while maintaining ~0.10 s latency on a single\non-prem GPU. These results indicate that near-frontier discrimination and\ngeneration-induced errors are structurally avoided in the clinical path by\nreturning vetted FAQ answers verbatim, supporting privacy, sustainability, and\nequitable deployment in bandwidth-limited environments.",

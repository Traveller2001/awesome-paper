  "title": "StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world\n  Markets?",
  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities\nas autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential\ndecision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains\nsuch as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain\nremains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and\nhigh-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test\nstatic knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing\nthe dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce\nStockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in\nrealistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market\nsignals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential\nbuy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics\nsuch as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our\nevaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and\nopen-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM\nagents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models\ndemonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more\neffectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in\ndeveloping LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static\nfinancial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful\ntrading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support\nreproducibility and advance future research in this domain.",

  "title": "FINCH: Financial Intelligence using Natural language for Contextualized\n  SQL Handling",
  "summary": "Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL\nqueries, has long been a central challenge in NLP. While progress has been\nsignificant, applying it to the financial domain remains especially difficult\ndue to complex schema, domain-specific terminology, and high stakes of error.\nDespite this, there is no dedicated large-scale financial dataset to advance\nresearch, creating a critical gap. To address this, we introduce a curated\nfinancial dataset (FINCH) comprising 292 tables and 75,725 natural language-SQL\npairs, enabling both fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation. Building on this\nresource, we benchmark reasoning models and language models of varying scales,\nproviding a systematic analysis of their strengths and limitations in financial\nText-to-SQL tasks. Finally, we propose a finance-oriented evaluation metric\n(FINCH Score) that captures nuances overlooked by existing measures, offering a\nmore faithful assessment of model performance.",

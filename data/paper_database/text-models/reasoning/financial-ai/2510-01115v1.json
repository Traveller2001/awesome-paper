  "title": "Exploring Network-Knowledge Graph Duality: A Case Study in Agentic\n  Supply Chain Risk Analysis",
  "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and\nnetwork-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are\ncostly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for\nsupply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent\nduality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain\nnetwork as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for\nretrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently\nextracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture\norchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables\nand news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive\ntemplates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative\ndata fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model\nto generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time\nwithout costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.",

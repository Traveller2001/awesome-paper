  "title": "Deep Hedging Under Non-Convexity: Limitations and a Case for AlphaZero",
  "summary": "This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets\n- a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging,\nbalance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a\ntwo-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes\nstrategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by\nthe success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an\nAlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely\nused industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis\nand experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the\n$Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving\nnon-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations -\nconverging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to\nhighlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds\nnear-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a\nconnection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its\neffectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further\nsuggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in\ndata-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.",

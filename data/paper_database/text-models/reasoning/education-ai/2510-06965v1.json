  "title": "EDUMATH: Generating Standards-aligned Educational Math Word Problems",
  "summary": "Math word problems (MWPs) are critical K-12 educational tools, and\ncustomizing them to students' interests and ability levels can increase\nlearning outcomes. However, teachers struggle to find time to customize MWPs\nfor each student given large class sizes and increasing burnout. We propose\nthat LLMs can support math education by generating MWPs customized to student\ninterests and math education standards. To this end, we use a joint human\nexpert-LLM judge approach to evaluate over 11,000 MWPs generated by open and\nclosed LLMs and develop the first teacher-annotated dataset for\nstandards-aligned educational MWP generation. We show the value of our data by\nusing it to train a 12B open model that matches the performance of larger and\nmore capable open models. We also use our teacher-annotated data to train a\ntext classifier that enables a 30B open LLM to outperform existing closed\nbaselines without any training. Next, we show our models' MWPs are more similar\nto human-written MWPs than those from existing models. We conclude by\nconducting the first study of customized LLM-generated MWPs with grade school\nstudents, finding they perform similarly on our models' MWPs relative to\nhuman-written MWPs but consistently prefer our customized MWPs.",

  "tldr_zh": "本研究提出EDUMATH系统，利用大语言模型生成符合教育标准的数学应用题。通过专家-LLM联合评估11,000+题目并构建首个教师标注数据集，训练出的12B模型性能媲美更大规模模型，且30B模型无需训练即可超越现有基线。学生测试表明，定制化题目与人工编写题目表现相当但更受青睐。",

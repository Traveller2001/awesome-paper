  "title": "Incorporating Expert Knowledge into Bayesian Causal Discovery of\n  Mixtures of Directed Acyclic Graphs",
  "summary": "Bayesian causal discovery benefits from prior information elicited from\ndomain experts, and in heterogeneous domains any prior knowledge would be badly\nneeded. However, so far prior elicitation approaches have assumed a single\ncausal graph and hence are not suited to heterogeneous domains. We propose a\ncausal elicitation strategy for heterogeneous settings, based on Bayesian\nexperimental design (BED) principles, and a variational mixture structure\nlearning (VaMSL) method -- extending the earlier differentiable Bayesian\nstructure learning (DiBS) method -- to iteratively infer mixtures of causal\nBayesian networks (CBNs). We construct an informative graph prior incorporating\nelicited expert feedback in the inference of mixtures of CBNs. Our proposed\nmethod successfully produces a set of alternative causal models (mixture\ncomponents or clusters), and achieves an improved structure learning\nperformance on heterogeneous synthetic data when informed by a simulated\nexpert. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach is capable of capturing\ncomplex distributions in a breast cancer database.",

  "title": "EMR-AGENT: Automating Cohort and Feature Extraction from EMR Databases",
  "summary": "Machine learning models for clinical prediction rely on structured data\nextracted from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), yet this process remains\ndominated by hardcoded, database-specific pipelines for cohort definition,\nfeature selection, and code mapping. These manual efforts limit scalability,\nreproducibility, and cross-institutional generalization. To address this, we\nintroduce EMR-AGENT (Automated Generalized Extraction and Navigation Tool), an\nagent-based framework that replaces manual rule writing with dynamic, language\nmodel-driven interaction to extract and standardize structured clinical data.\nOur framework automates cohort selection, feature extraction, and code mapping\nthrough interactive querying of databases. Our modular agents iteratively\nobserve query results and reason over schema and documentation, using SQL not\njust for data retrieval but also as a tool for database observation and\ndecision making. This eliminates the need for hand-crafted, schema-specific\nlogic. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop a benchmarking codebase for\nthree EMR databases (MIMIC-III, eICU, SICdb), including both seen and unseen\nschema settings. Our results demonstrate strong performance and generalization\nacross these databases, highlighting the feasibility of automating a process\npreviously thought to require expert-driven design. The code will be released\npublicly at https://github.com/AITRICS/EMR-AGENT/tree/main. For a\ndemonstration, please visit our anonymous demo page:\nhttps://anonymoususer-max600.github.io/EMR_AGENT/",

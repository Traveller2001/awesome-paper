  "title": "Mining the Mind: What 100M Beliefs Reveal About Frontier LLM Knowledge",
  "summary": "LLMs are remarkable artifacts that have revolutionized a range of NLP and AI\ntasks. A significant contributor is their factual knowledge, which, to date,\nremains poorly understood, and is usually analyzed from biased samples. In this\npaper, we take a deep tour into the factual knowledge (or beliefs) of a\nfrontier LLM, based on GPTKB v1.5 (Hu et al., 2025a), a recursively elicited\nset of 100 million beliefs of one of the strongest currently available frontier\nLLMs, GPT-4.1. We find that the models' factual knowledge differs quite\nsignificantly from established knowledge bases, and that its accuracy is\nsignificantly lower than indicated by previous benchmarks. We also find that\ninconsistency, ambiguity and hallucinations are major issues, shedding light on\nfuture research opportunities concerning factual LLM knowledge.",

  "title": "ThinkBrake: Mitigating Overthinking in Tool Reasoning",
  "summary": "Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a\ncorrect tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it\nwith an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that\ninject </think> at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling\nLeaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\\%\nto 94.2\\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\\%, revealing substantial recoverable\nheadroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise\nreasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains\nunderexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and\nintroduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors\nthe log-probability margin between </think> and the current top token at\nsentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small.\nAcross BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or\nimproves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\\%, outperforming various\nbaselines.",

  "title": "Fine-Grained Emotion Recognition via In-Context Learning",
  "summary": "Fine-grained emotion recognition aims to identify the emotional type in\nqueries through reasoning and decision-making processes, playing a crucial role\nin various systems. Recent methods use In-Context Learning (ICL), enhancing the\nrepresentation of queries in the reasoning process through semantically similar\nexamples, while further improving emotion recognition by explaining the\nreasoning mechanisms. However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but\noverlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making\nin fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL\nrelies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional\nprototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are\ncritical. However, semantically similar examples often introduce emotional\ndiscrepancies, hindering accurate representations and causing errors. To\naddress this, we propose Emotion In-Context Learning (EICL), which introduces\nemotionally similar examples and uses a dynamic soft-label strategy to improve\nquery representations in the emotion reasoning process. A two-stage exclusion\nstrategy is then employed to assess similarity from multiple angles, further\noptimizing the decision-making process. Extensive experiments show that EICL\nsignificantly outperforms ICL on multiple datasets.",

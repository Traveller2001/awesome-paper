  "title": "Exploring Gaps in the APS: Direct Minimal Pair Analysis in LLM Syntactic\n  Assessments",
  "summary": "Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)\nhave applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex\nsyntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise\nquestions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.\n(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the \"wh-effect\") to demonstrate\nthat models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan\net al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that\nmodels largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct\nminimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate\nthis by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and\nevaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic\nWilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across\nall four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing\nprinciples even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with\nthe more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of\nevaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.",

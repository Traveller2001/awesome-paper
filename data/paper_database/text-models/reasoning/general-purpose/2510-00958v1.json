  "title": "Test-Time Search in Neural Graph Coarsening Procedures for the\n  Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem",
  "summary": "The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity\ninequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the\nCapacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based\nseparation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals\nthat the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently\nsensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes\nan alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time\nthrough a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce\nstochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the\npreviously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening\nHistory-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening\nhistory to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed\ncapacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared\nto the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers\neffective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of\nidentifying such cuts.",

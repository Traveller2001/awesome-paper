  "title": "ARUQULA -- An LLM based Text2SPARQL Approach using ReAct and Knowledge\n  Graph Exploration Utilities",
  "summary": "Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a\nbackground in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL)\nhas a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that\nbarrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this\npaper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent\nthat translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single\nshot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the\noverall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also\nconduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future\nareas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL\nchallenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the\nText2SPARQL domain.",

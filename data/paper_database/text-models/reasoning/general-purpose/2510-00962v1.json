  "title": "Analyzing Dialectical Biases in LLMs for Knowledge and Reasoning\n  Benchmarks",
  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language\nprocessing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for\nunder-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying\n\"standard\" American English language questions as non-\"standard\" dialectal\nvariants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20%\nreduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of\nunder-performance in non-\"standard\" English questions. We find that individual\ngrammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more\nconsequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential \"it\", zero\ncopula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed\nin multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation\nmethods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.",

  "title": "Revisiting the Uniform Information Density Hypothesis in LLM Reasoning\n  Traces",
  "summary": "The Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that effective\ncommunication maintains a stable flow of information. In this work, we revisit\nthis principle in the context of large language model (LLM) reasoning traces,\nasking whether step-level uniformity reflects reasoning quality. To this end,\nwe propose an entropy-based stepwise information density metric and introduce\ntwo complementary measures of uniformity, local and global uniformity scores.\nAcross the experiments on six different reasoning benchmarks, we find that\nstep-level uniformity not only provides a strong theoretical lens but also\nyields practical performance benefits; for example, selecting reasoning traces\nwith more uniform information density at the step-level improves accuracy by\n10-32\\% relative gains over baselines at AIME2025. Our analysis further reveals\nthat correct reasoning traces tend to avoid sharp information density spikes,\nwhile incorrect traces exhibit irregular information bursts. These results\ndemonstrate that UID-inspired information density measures outperform\nalternative internal signals as predictors of reasoning quality. Results\nhighlight the uniformity of the information density as a robust diagnostic and\nselection criterion for building more reliable and accurate reasoning systems.",

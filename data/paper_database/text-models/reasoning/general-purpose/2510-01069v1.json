  "title": "Typed Chain-of-Thought: A Curry-Howard Framework for Verifying LLM\n  Reasoning",
  "summary": "While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of\nlarge language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an\nopen problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens\nfor this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a\ndirect relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this\nparadigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,\nwhere each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We\noperationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the\ninformal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.\nSuccessfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,\nverifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond\nheuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides\na methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally\nverifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and\ntrustworthy AI systems.",

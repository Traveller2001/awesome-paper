  "title": "Inductive Learning for Possibilistic Logic Programs Under Stable Models",
  "summary": "Possibilistic logic programs (poss-programs) under stable models are a major\nvariant of answer set programming (ASP). While its semantics (possibilistic\nstable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of\ninductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an\napproach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples\n(parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of\ninduction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and\ntwo algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are\npresented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental\nresults show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype\noutperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from\nstable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.",

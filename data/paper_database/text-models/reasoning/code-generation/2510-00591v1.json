  "title": "AI-Driven Self-Evolving Software: A Promising Path Toward Software\n  Automation",
  "summary": "Software automation has long been a central goal of software engineering,\nstriving for software development that proceeds without human intervention.\nRecent efforts have leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to advance software\nautomation with notable progress. However, current AI functions primarily as\nassistants to human developers, leaving software development still dependent on\nexplicit human intervention. This raises a fundamental question: Can AI move\nbeyond its role as an assistant to become a core component of software, thereby\nenabling genuine software automation? To investigate this vision, we introduce\nAI-Driven Self-Evolving Software, a new form of software that evolves\ncontinuously through direct interaction with users. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this idea with a lightweight prototype built on a multi-agent\narchitecture that autonomously interprets user requirements, generates and\nvalidates code, and integrates new functionalities. Case studies across\nmultiple representative scenarios show that the prototype can reliably\nconstruct and reuse functionality, providing early evidence that such software\nsystems can scale to more sophisticated applications and pave the way toward\ntruly automated software development. We make code and cases in this work\npublicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/live-software.",

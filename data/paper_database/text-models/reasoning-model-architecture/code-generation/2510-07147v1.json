  "title": "A Multi-Agent Framework for Stateful Inference-Time Search",
  "summary": "Recent work explores agentic inference-time techniques to perform structured,\nmulti-step reasoning. However, stateless inference often struggles on\nmulti-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent\ninference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless\nsingle-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,\nGemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time\nstate with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation.",

  "summary": "We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease\noutcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each\nround, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may\neither pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true\nlabel--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their\nfeature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of\ncostly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of\nmisclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\\alpha$,\nwith probability at least $1-\\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel\nalgorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to\nestimate both $\\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a\nconservative, data-driven threshold $\\tau_t$ on the logistic score\n$|x_t^\\top\\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with\nprobability at least $1-\\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target\nmisclassification rate, and requires only $O(\\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared\nto the oracle baseline that knows both $\\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature\ndistribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for\nerror-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive\nmedical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing\nthat in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\\theta^{*}$ while\nretaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.",

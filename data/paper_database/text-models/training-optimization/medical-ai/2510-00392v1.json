  "title": "A Deep Learning Pipeline for Epilepsy Genomic Analysis Using GPT-2 XL\n  and NVIDIA H100",
  "summary": "Epilepsy is a chronic neurological condition characterized by recurrent\nseizures, with global prevalence estimated at 50 million people worldwide.\nWhile progress in high-throughput sequencing has allowed for broad-based\ntranscriptomic profiling of brain tissues, the deciphering of these highly\ncomplex datasets remains one of the challenges. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a new analysis pipeline that integrates the power of deep\nlearning strategies with GPU-acceleration computation for investigating Gene\nexpression patterns in epilepsy. Specifically, our proposed approach employs\nGPT-2 XL, a transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) with 1.5 billion\nparameters for genomic sequence analysis over the latest NVIDIA H100 Tensor\nCore GPUs based on Hopper architecture. Our proposed method enables efficient\npreprocessing of RNA sequence data, gene sequence encoding, and subsequent\npattern identification. We conducted experiments on two epilepsy datasets\nincluding GEO accession GSE264537 and GSE275235. The obtained results reveal\nseveral significant transcriptomic modifications, including reduced hippocampal\nastrogliosis after ketogenic diet treatment as well as restored\nexcitatory-inhibitory signaling equilibrium in zebrafish epilepsy model.\nMoreover, our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging LLMs in\ncombination with advanced hardware acceleration for transcriptomic\ncharacterization in neurological diseases.",

  "title": "Fast Leave-One-Out Approximation from Fragment-Target Prevalence Vectors\n  (molFTP) : From Dummy Masking to Key-LOO for Leakage-Free Feature\n  Construction",
  "summary": "We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact\nrepresentation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature\nleakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure\nthat removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We\nfurther show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true\nmolecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.\nThis enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation\nestimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,\nleakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical\nsafeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its\ncost.",

  "title": "Improving Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Detection through Ensemble-Based\n  Models and Synthetic Oversampling Techniques",
  "summary": "This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency\nmarkets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and\nhinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority\nOversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning\nmodels were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal\nmarket activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly\nenhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall\nand improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,\nXGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,\nrespectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational\nperformance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These\nfindings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble\nmethods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,\ncontributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency\nmarket.",

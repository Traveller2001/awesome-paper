  "title": "Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time\n  Series Foundation Models",
  "summary": "Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast\ntrajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation\nmodels have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality\nand efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict\nindependent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint\npredictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic\ncorrelation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which\ncan be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach\nto efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing\nmulti-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based\napproach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than\nautoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by\nmitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.",

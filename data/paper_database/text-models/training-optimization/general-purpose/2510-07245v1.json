  "title": "Discriminative Feature Feedback with General Teacher Classes",
  "summary": "We study the theoretical properties of the interactive learning protocol\nDiscriminative Feature Feedback (DFF) (Dasgupta et al., 2018). The DFF learning\nprotocol uses feedback in the form of discriminative feature explanations. We\nprovide the first systematic study of DFF in a general framework that is\ncomparable to that of classical protocols such as supervised learning and\nonline learning. We study the optimal mistake bound of DFF in the realizable\nand the non-realizable settings, and obtain novel structural results, as well\nas insights into the differences between Online Learning and settings with\nricher feedback such as DFF. We characterize the mistake bound in the\nrealizable setting using a new notion of dimension. In the non-realizable\nsetting, we provide a mistake upper bound and show that it cannot be improved\nin general. Our results show that unlike Online Learning, in DFF the realizable\ndimension is insufficient to characterize the optimal non-realizable mistake\nbound or the existence of no-regret algorithms.",

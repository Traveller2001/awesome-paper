  "title": "COM-BOM: Bayesian Exemplar Search for Efficiently Exploring the\n  Accuracy-Calibration Pareto Frontier",
  "summary": "Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of\nin-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize\nfor predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key\ndeterminant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate\nexemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly\ntargeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of\nexpected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient\nCombinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto\nfront that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.\nWe evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and\nfind that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two\nobjectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.",

  "title": "Bridging the Gap Between Simulated and Real Network Data Using Transfer\n  Learning",
  "summary": "Machine Learning (ML)-based network models provide fast and accurate\npredictions for complex network behaviors but require substantial training\ndata. Collecting such data from real networks is often costly and limited,\nespecially for critical scenarios like failures. As a result, researchers\ncommonly rely on simulated data, which reduces accuracy when models are\ndeployed in real environments. We propose a hybrid approach leveraging transfer\nlearning to combine simulated and real-world data. Using RouteNet-Fermi, we\nshow that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with a small real dataset\nsignificantly improves performance. Our experiments with OMNeT++ and a custom\ntestbed reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in packet delay\nprediction by up to 88%. With just 10 real scenarios, MAPE drops by 37%, and\nwith 50 scenarios, by 48%.",

  "title": "Lower Bounds on Adversarial Robustness for Multiclass Classification\n  with General Loss Functions",
  "summary": "We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under\narbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the\ncorresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide\nexplicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss,\nloss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way\navailable results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient\ncomputation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the\ndesign of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers\ninteresting connections between adversarial robustness, $\\alpha$-fair packing\nproblems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures\nwhere Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our\ntheoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments\nwhere we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the\ncross-entropy loss function.",

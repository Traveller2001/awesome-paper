  "title": "DeMuon: A Decentralized Muon for Matrix Optimization over Graphs",
  "summary": "In this paper, we propose DeMuon, a method for decentralized matrix\noptimization over a given communication topology. DeMuon incorporates matrix\northogonalization via Newton-Schulz iterations-a technique inherited from its\ncentralized predecessor, Muon-and employs gradient tracking to mitigate\nheterogeneity among local functions. Under heavy-tailed noise conditions and\nadditional mild assumptions, we establish the iteration complexity of DeMuon\nfor reaching an approximate stochastic stationary point. This complexity result\nmatches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of\ndependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the\nfirst direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with\nprovable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on\ndecentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of\nconnectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement\nof DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network\ntopologies.",

  "title": "QUASAR: Quantum Assembly Code Generation Using Tool-Augmented LLMs via\n  Agentic RL",
  "summary": "Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to\nleverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model\n(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic\nsolution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)\nparameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal\nperformance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of\nquantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)\nLLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack\nof quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and\noptimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with\nquantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR\ndesigns (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum\nsimulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL\ntraining. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic\nperformance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR\nhas achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,\noutperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several\nsupervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.",

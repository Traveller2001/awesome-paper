  "title": "Extracting O*NET Features from the NLx Corpus to Build Public Use\n  Aggregate Labor Market Data",
  "summary": "Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a\nstandard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and\noccupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on\nsmall survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural\nlanguage processing tools that extract structured information from job\npostings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of\nopen-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and\naccuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10\nbillion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the\nNational Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation\ncodes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more\nfeatures. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and\nindustry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We\nillustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and\nworkforce development.",

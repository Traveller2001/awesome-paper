  "summary": "The safe use of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals is vital to protect\nanimal welfare and human food safety. Adverse events (AEs) may signal\nunexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of\nviolative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive\nframework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million\nreports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary\nMedicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized\nAEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed,\nand high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were\nintegrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models,\nincluding Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language\nmodels (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as\nundersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal\noutcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best,\nachieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average\nUncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved\nminority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost.\nInterpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors,\nincluding lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug\nphysicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal\noutcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data\nengineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate,\ninterpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports\nFARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles,\nstrengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical\ndecision-making.",

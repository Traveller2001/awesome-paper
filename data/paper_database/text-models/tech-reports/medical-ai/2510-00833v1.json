  "title": "Towards Verifiable Federated Unlearning: Framework, Challenges, and The\n  Road Ahead",
  "summary": "Federated unlearning (FUL) enables removing the data influence from the model\ntrained across distributed clients, upholding the right to be forgotten as\nmandated by privacy regulations. FUL facilitates a value exchange where clients\ngain privacy-preserving control over their data contributions, while service\nproviders leverage decentralized computing and data freshness. However, this\nentire proposition is undermined because clients have no reliable way to verify\nthat their data influence has been provably removed, as current metrics and\nsimple notifications offer insufficient assurance. We envision unlearning\nverification becoming a pivotal and trust-by-design part of the FUL life-cycle\ndevelopment, essential for highly regulated and data-sensitive services and\napplications like healthcare. This article introduces veriFUL, a reference\nframework for verifiable FUL that formalizes verification entities, goals,\napproaches, and metrics. Specifically, we consolidate existing efforts and\ncontribute new insights, concepts, and metrics to this domain. Finally, we\nhighlight research challenges and identify potential applications and\ndevelopments for verifiable FUL and veriFUL.",

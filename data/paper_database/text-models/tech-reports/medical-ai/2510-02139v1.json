  "title": "BioinfoMCP: A Unified Platform Enabling MCP Interfaces in Agentic\n  Bioinformatics",
  "summary": "Bioinformatics tools are essential for complex computational biology tasks,\nyet their integration with emerging AI-agent frameworks is hindered by\nincompatible interfaces, heterogeneous input-output formats, and inconsistent\nparameter conventions. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized\nframework for tool-AI communication, but manually converting hundreds of\nexisting and rapidly growing specialized bioinformatics tools into\nMCP-compliant servers is labor-intensive and unsustainable. Here, we present\nBioinfoMCP, a unified platform comprising two components: BioinfoMCP Converter,\nwhich automatically generates robust MCP servers from tool documentation using\nlarge language models, and BioinfoMCP Benchmark, which systematically validates\nthe reliability and versatility of converted tools across diverse computational\ntasks. We present a platform of 38 MCP-converted bioinformatics tools,\nextensively validated to show that 94.7% successfully executed complex\nworkflows across three widely used AI-agent platforms. By removing technical\nbarriers to AI automation, BioinfoMCP enables natural-language interaction with\nsophisticated bioinformatics analyses without requiring extensive programming\nexpertise, offering a scalable path to intelligent, interoperable computational\nbiology.",

  "title": "SIEVE: Towards Verifiable Certification for Code-datasets",
  "summary": "Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets,\nyet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards'\ninform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical\nguarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build\nisolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We\npresent SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into\nConfidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid\nstatistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity,\nreplacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is\nexpected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.",

  "title": "A-VERT: Agnostic Verification with Embedding Ranking Targets",
  "summary": "The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece\nin the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and\nquality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to\nresponse classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e.\nLLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching,\nlogprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The\nmethod makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates\nwith arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the\nresponse at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$\nparameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of\n~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM\narchitectures.",

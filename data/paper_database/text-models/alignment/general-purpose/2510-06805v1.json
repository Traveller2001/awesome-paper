  "title": "Overview of the Plagiarism Detection Task at PAN 2025",
  "summary": "The generative plagiarism detection task at PAN 2025 aims at identifying\nautomatically generated textual plagiarism in scientific articles and aligning\nthem with their respective sources. We created a novel large-scale dataset of\nautomatically generated plagiarism using three large language models: Llama,\nDeepSeek-R1, and Mistral. In this task overview paper, we outline the creation\nof this dataset, summarize and compare the results of all participants and four\nbaselines, and evaluate the results on the last plagiarism detection task from\nPAN 2015 in order to interpret the robustness of the proposed approaches. We\nfound that the current iteration does not invite a large variety of approaches\nas naive semantic similarity approaches based on embedding vectors provide\npromising results of up to 0.8 recall and 0.5 precision. In contrast, most of\nthese approaches underperform significantly on the 2015 dataset, indicating a\nlack in generalizability.",

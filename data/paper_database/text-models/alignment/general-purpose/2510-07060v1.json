  "title": "Does Local News Stay Local?: Online Content Shifts in Sinclair-Acquired\n  Stations",
  "summary": "Local news stations are often considered to be reliable sources of\nnon-politicized information, particularly local concerns that residents care\nabout. Because these stations are trusted news sources, viewers are\nparticularly susceptible to the information they report. The Sinclair Broadcast\ngroup is a broadcasting company that has acquired many local news stations in\nthe last decade. We investigate the effects of local news stations being\nacquired by Sinclair: how does coverage change? We use computational methods to\ninvestigate changes in internet content put out by local news stations before\nand after being acquired by Sinclair and in comparison to national news\noutlets. We find that there is clear evidence that local news stations report\nmore frequently on national news at the expense of local topics, and that their\ncoverage of polarizing national topics increases.",

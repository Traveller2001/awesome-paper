  "title": "Human-AI Teaming Co-Learning in Military Operations",
  "summary": "In a time of rapidly evolving military threats and increasingly complex\noperational environments, the integration of AI into military operations proves\nsignificant advantages. At the same time, this implies various challenges and\nrisks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective\nand ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often\ntackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as\na collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the\nsystem assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional\nresponsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research\nproposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in\nmilitary operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of\ninsights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving\nbattlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First,\nadjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents\ndepending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental\nuncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight,\nmonitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback\nwith explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper\ncommunication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of\nthe agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the\ngeneration, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence\nlevels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete\nexemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing\nresponsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.",

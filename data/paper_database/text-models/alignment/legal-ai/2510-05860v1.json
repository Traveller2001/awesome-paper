  "title": "Automated Boilerplate: Prevalence and Quality of Contract Generators in\n  the Context of Swiss Privacy Policies",
  "summary": "It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of\nnovel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that\noften lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.\nInstead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to\ncheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract\ngenerators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little\nempirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.\n  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To\nenable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark\ndataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy\nlaw. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale\ncompliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of\nthe revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the\nrevision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are\nassociated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up\nto 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.\nThese findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for\ncross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,\ncrucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual\nquality.",

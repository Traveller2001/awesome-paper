  "title": "Pragyaan: Designing and Curating High-Quality Cultural Post-Training\n  Datasets for Indian Languages",
  "summary": "The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the\navailability of high-quality post-training data, particularly\ninstruction-tuning and preference-based examples. Existing open-source\ndatasets, however, often lack multilingual coverage, cultural grounding, and\nsuffer from task diversity gaps that are especially pronounced for Indian\nlanguages. We introduce a human-in-the-loop pipeline that combines translations\nwith synthetic expansion to produce reliable and diverse Indic post-training\ndata. Using this pipeline, we curate two datasets: Pragyaan-IT (22.5K) and\nPragyaan-Align (100K) across 10 Indian languages covering 13 broad and 56\nsub-categories, leveraging 57 diverse datasets. Our dataset protocol\nincorporates several often-overlooked dimensions and emphasize task diversity,\nmulti-turn dialogue, instruction fidelity, safety alignment, and preservation\nof cultural nuance, providing a foundation for more inclusive and effective\nmultilingual LLMs.",

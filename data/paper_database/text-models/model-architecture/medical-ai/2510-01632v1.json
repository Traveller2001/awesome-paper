  "title": "BioBlobs: Differentiable Graph Partitioning for Protein Representation\n  Learning",
  "summary": "Protein function is driven by coherent substructures which vary in size and\ntopology, yet current protein representation learning models (PRL) distort\nthese signals by relying on rigid substructures such as k-hop and fixed radius\nneighbourhoods. We introduce BioBlobs, a plug-and-play, fully differentiable\nmodule that represents proteins by dynamically partitioning structures into\nflexibly-sized, non-overlapping substructures (\"blobs\"). The resulting blobs\nare quantized into a shared and interpretable codebook, yielding a discrete\nvocabulary of function-relevant protein substructures used to compute protein\nembeddings. We show that BioBlobs representations improve the performance of\nwidely used protein encoders such as GVP-GNN across various PRL tasks. Our\napproach highlights the value of architectures that directly capture\nfunction-relevant protein substructures, enabling both improved predictive\nperformance and mechanistic insight into protein function.",

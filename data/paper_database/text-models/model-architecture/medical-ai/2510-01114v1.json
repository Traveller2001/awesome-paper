  "title": "PRISM-Consult: A Panel-of-Experts Architecture for Clinician-Aligned\n  Diagnosis",
  "summary": "We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture\nthat extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain\nspecialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a\nlight-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist\nmodels (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,\nPsychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and\ntoken template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On\nreal-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence\nwith low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves\nhigh routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a\nsafety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive\nICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain\nresults to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical\npath to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline\nvalidation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat\nthresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment\nstandards.",

  "title": "Modeling COVID-19 Dynamics in German States Using Physics-Informed\n  Neural Networks",
  "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for quantitative modeling and\nanalysis to understand real-world disease dynamics. In particular, post hoc\nanalyses using compartmental models offer valuable insights into the\neffectiveness of public health interventions, such as vaccination strategies\nand containment policies. However, such compartmental models like SIR\n(Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) often face limitations in directly\nincorporating noisy observational data. In this work, we employ\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the inverse problem of the\nSIR model using infection data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI). Our main\ncontribution is a fine-grained, spatio-temporal analysis of COVID-19 dynamics\nacross all German federal states over a three-year period. We estimate\nstate-specific transmission and recovery parameters and time-varying\nreproduction number (R_t) to track the pandemic progression. The results\nhighlight strong variations in transmission behavior across regions, revealing\ncorrelations with vaccination uptake and temporal patterns associated with\nmajor pandemic phases. Our findings demonstrate the utility of PINNs in\nlocalized, long-term epidemiological modeling.",

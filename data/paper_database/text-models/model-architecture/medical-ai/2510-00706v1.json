  "title": "AttentionDep: Domain-Aware Attention for Explainable Depression Severity\n  Assessment",
  "summary": "In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window\ninto individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores\nthe use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for\ndepression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware\nattention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by\nfusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using\nunigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically\nrelevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph\nis incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual\nfeatures. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression\nframework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity\nlevels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while\nproviding interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the\ndevelopment of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health\nassessment from social media.",

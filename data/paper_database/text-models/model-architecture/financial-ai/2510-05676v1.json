  "title": "Inductive inference of gradient-boosted decision trees on graphs for\n  insurance fraud detection",
  "summary": "Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due\nto their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a\nprime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals\nthat stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple\npolicies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find\nmeaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance\npresent in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and\ndynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.\nThat is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the\nfield. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine\n(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show\nthat our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an\nexperiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power\nof G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,\nproprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting\nforest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights\ninto the predictions made by G-GBM.",

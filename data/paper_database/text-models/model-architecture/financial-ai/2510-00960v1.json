  "title": "A Neuro-Fuzzy System for Interpretable Long-Term Stock Market\n  Forecasting",
  "summary": "In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving\nboth accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper\nintroduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network\narchitecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference\nsystems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time\nseries forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention\nto condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy\ninference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting\nperformance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing\nmeaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the\nreal world stock market index S\\&P500. Initial results show potential for\ninterpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,\nsuggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market\nbehavior.",

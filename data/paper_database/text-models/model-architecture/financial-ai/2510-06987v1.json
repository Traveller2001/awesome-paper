  "title": "Spiral Model Technique For Data Science & Machine Learning Lifecycle",
  "summary": "Analytics play an important role in modern business. Companies adapt data\nscience lifecycles to their culture to seek productivity and improve their\ncompetitiveness among others. Data science lifecycles are fairly an important\ncontributing factor to start and end a project that are data dependent. Data\nscience and Machine learning life cycles comprises of series of steps that are\ninvolved in a project. A typical life cycle states that it is a linear or\ncyclical model that revolves around. It is mostly depicted that it is possible\nin a traditional data science life cycle to start the process again after\nreaching the end of cycle. This paper suggests a new technique to incorporate\ndata science life cycle to business problems that have a clear end goal. A new\ntechnique called spiral technique is introduced to emphasize versatility,\nagility and iterative approach to business processes.",

  "title": "A Formal Framework for Fluency-based Multi-Reference Evaluation in\n  Grammatical Error Correction",
  "summary": "Evaluating grammatical error correction requires metrics that reflect the\ndiversity of valid human corrections rather than privileging a single\nreference. Existing frameworks, largely edit-based and English-centric, rely on\nrigid alignments between system and reference edits, limiting their\napplicability in multilingual and generative settings. This paper introduces a\nformal framework for \\textit{fluency-based multi-reference evaluation}, framing\n$n$-gram similarity as an aggregation problem over multiple legitimate\ncorrections. Within this formulation, we instantiate GLEU through four\naggregation strategies--\\textsc{select-best}, \\textsc{simple-average},\n\\textsc{weighted-average}, and \\textsc{merged-counts}--and analyze their\nproperties of boundedness, monotonicity, and sensitivity to reference\nvariation. Empirical results on Czech, Estonian, Ukrainian, and Chinese corpora\nshow that these strategies capture complementary aspects of fluency and\ncoverage. The framework unifies multi-reference evaluation into a principled,\nfluency-oriented approach that incorporates linguistic diversity without\npenalizing legitimate variation.",

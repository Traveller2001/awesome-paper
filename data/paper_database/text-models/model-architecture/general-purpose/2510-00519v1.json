  "title": "Architectural Transformations and Emerging Verification Demands in\n  AI-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems",
  "summary": "In the world of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), a captivating real-time fusion\noccurs where digital technology meets the physical world. This synergy has been\nsignificantly transformed by the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), a\nmove that dramatically enhances system adaptability and introduces a layer of\ncomplexity that impacts CPS control optimization and reliability. Despite\nadvancements in AI integration, a significant gap remains in understanding how\nthis shift affects CPS architecture, operational complexity, and verification\npractices. The extended abstract addresses this gap by investigating\narchitectural distinctions between AI-driven and traditional control models\ndesigned in Simulink and their respective implications for system verification.",

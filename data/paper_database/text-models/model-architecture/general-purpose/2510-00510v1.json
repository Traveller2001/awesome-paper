  "summary": "Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for\ncomplex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated\nimprovements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We\npropose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components:\na collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with\ncritic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic,\nand procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and\nmultimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework\nconsistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance\nof proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of\nsystem-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and\nadaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.",

  "title": "Early wind turbine alarm prediction based on machine learning:\n  AlarmForecasting",
  "summary": "Alarm data is pivotal in curbing fault behavior in Wind Turbines (WTs) and\nforms the backbone for advancedpredictive monitoring systems. Traditionally,\nresearch cohorts have been confined to utilizing alarm data solelyas a\ndiagnostic tool, merely indicative of unhealthy status. However, this study\naims to offer a transformativeleap towards preempting alarms, preventing alarms\nfrom triggering altogether, and consequently avertingimpending failures. Our\nproposed Alarm Forecasting and Classification (AFC) framework is designed on\ntwosuccessive modules: first, the regression module based on long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) for time-series alarmforecasting, and thereafter, the\nclassification module to implement alarm tagging on the forecasted alarm.\nThisway, the entire alarm taxonomy can be forecasted reliably rather than a few\nspecific alarms. 14 Senvion MM82turbines with an operational period of 5 years\nare used as a case study; the results demonstrated 82%, 52%,and 41% accurate\nforecasts for 10, 20, and 30 min alarm forecasts, respectively. The results\nsubstantiateanticipating and averting alarms, which is significant in curbing\nalarm frequency and enhancing operationalefficiency through proactive\nintervention.",

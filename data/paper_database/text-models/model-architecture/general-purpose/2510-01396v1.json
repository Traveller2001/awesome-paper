  "title": "Neural Network Surrogates for Free Energy Computation of Complex\n  Chemical Systems",
  "summary": "Free energy reconstruction methods such as Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)\nrequire Jacobians of the collective variables (CVs), a bottleneck that\nrestricts the use of complex or machine-learned CVs. We introduce a neural\nnetwork surrogate framework that learns CVs directly from Cartesian coordinates\nand uses automatic differentiation to provide Jacobians, bypassing analytical\nforms. On an MgCl2 ion-pairing system, our method achieved high accuracy for\nboth a simple distance CV and a complex coordination-number CV. Moreover,\nJacobian errors also followed a near-Gaussian distribution, making them\nsuitable for GPR pipelines. This framework enables gradient-based free energy\nmethods to incorporate complex and machine-learned CVs, broadening the scope of\nbiochemistry and materials simulations.",

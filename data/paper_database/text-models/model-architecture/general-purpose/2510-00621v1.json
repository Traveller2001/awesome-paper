  "title": "FAME: Adaptive Functional Attention with Expert Routing for\n  Function-on-Function Regression",
  "summary": "Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their\ninfinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.\nConventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or\nkernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many\ndeep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring\ninherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a\nMixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for\nfunction-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a\nbidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector\nfields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to\ninter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show\nthat FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily\nsampled discrete observations of functions.",

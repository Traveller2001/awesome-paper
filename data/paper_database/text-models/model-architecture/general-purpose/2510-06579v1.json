  "title": "TinyScientist: An Interactive, Extensible, and Controllable Framework\n  for Building Research Agents",
  "summary": "Automatic research with Large Language Models (LLMs) is rapidly gaining\nimportance, driving the development of increasingly complex workflows involving\nmulti-agent systems, planning, tool usage, code execution, and human-agent\ninteraction to accelerate research processes. However, as more researchers and\ndevelopers begin to use and build upon these tools and platforms, the\ncomplexity and difficulty of extending and maintaining such agentic workflows\nhave become a significant challenge, particularly as algorithms and\narchitectures continue to advance. To address this growing complexity,\nTinyScientist identifies the essential components of the automatic research\nworkflow and proposes an interactive, extensible, and controllable framework\nthat easily adapts to new tools and supports iterative growth. We provide an\nopen-source codebase, an interactive web demonstration, and a PyPI Python\npackage to make state-of-the-art auto-research pipelines broadly accessible to\nevery researcher and developer.",

  "title": "Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Efficiency in Conformalized Regression",
  "summary": "Conformal prediction provides prediction sets with coverage guarantees. The\ninformativeness of conformal prediction depends on its efficiency, typically\nquantified by the expected size of the prediction set. Prior work on the\nefficiency of conformalized regression commonly treats the miscoverage level\n$\\alpha$ as a fixed constant. In this work, we establish non-asymptotic bounds\non the deviation of the prediction set length from the oracle interval length\nfor conformalized quantile and median regression trained via SGD, under mild\nassumptions on the data distribution. Our bounds of order\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n} + 1/(\\alpha^2 n) + 1/\\sqrt{m} + \\exp(-\\alpha^2 m))$\ncapture the joint dependence of efficiency on the proper training set size $n$,\nthe calibration set size $m$, and the miscoverage level $\\alpha$. The results\nidentify phase transitions in convergence rates across different regimes of\n$\\alpha$, offering guidance for allocating data to control excess prediction\nset length. Empirical results are consistent with our theoretical findings.",

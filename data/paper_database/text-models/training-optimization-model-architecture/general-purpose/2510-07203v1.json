  "title": "Sunflower: A New Approach To Expanding Coverage of African Languages in\n  Large Language Models",
  "summary": "There are more than 2000 living languages in Africa, most of which have been\nbypassed by advances in language technology. Current leading LLMs exhibit\nstrong performance on a number of the most common languages (e.g. Swahili or\nYoruba), but prioritise support for the languages with the most speakers first,\nresulting in piecemeal ability across disparate languages. We contend that a\nregionally focussed approach is more efficient, and present a case study for\nUganda, a country with high linguistic diversity. We describe the development\nof Sunflower 14B and 32B, a pair of models based on Qwen 3 with state of the\nart comprehension in the majority of all Ugandan languages. These models are\nopen source and can be used to reduce language barriers in a number of\nimportant practical applications.",

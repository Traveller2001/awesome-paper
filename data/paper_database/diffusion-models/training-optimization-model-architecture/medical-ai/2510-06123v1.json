  "title": "Towards Data-Efficient Medical Imaging: A Generative and Semi-Supervised\n  Framework",
  "summary": "Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced\nannotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class\nspecific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to\nenhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a\nstandalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data\nwith StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo\nlabeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate\nconsistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet\nInception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.\nThese results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation\nbottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.",

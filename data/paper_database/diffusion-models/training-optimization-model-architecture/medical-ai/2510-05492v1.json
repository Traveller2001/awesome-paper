  "title": "High-Fidelity Synthetic ECG Generation via Mel-Spectrogram Informed\n  Diffusion Training",
  "summary": "The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by\nprivacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.\nAlthough generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of\nexisting model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in\ntrustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major\nshortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological\nfidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific\nphysiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional\ndiffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled\ninnovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a\nnovel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce\nphysiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning\nto enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach\non the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,\nclinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG\nachieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves\nstrong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by\n4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,\nwhile demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and\npersonalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets\nsupplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a\nclassifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG\nsynthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural\nregularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,\nprivacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the\nresponsible use of generative AI in healthcare.",

  "title": "Measurement-Guided Consistency Model Sampling for Inverse Problems",
  "summary": "Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse\nimaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits\npractical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling\nhigh-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct\nadaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a\nmodified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem\nreconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a\nmeasurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which\nenforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency\nof consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom\ndatasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level\nmetrics, including Fr\\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance,\npeak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared\nto baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior\nreconstructions with only a handful of steps.",

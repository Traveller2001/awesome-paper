  "title": "Pure-Pass: Fine-Grained, Adaptive Masking for Dynamic Token-Mixing\n  Routing in Lightweight Image Super-Resolution",
  "summary": "Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from\nlow-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep\nlearning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the\npioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods\nand proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities\naccording to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations\nremain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial\ninflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking\nmechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive\ncomputations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into\ndistinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while\nmaintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art\nATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal\noverhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and\nparameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.",

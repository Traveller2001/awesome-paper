  "title": "Control-Augmented Autoregressive Diffusion for Data Assimilation",
  "summary": "Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion\nmodels, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains\nunderexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained\nARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing\nfuture ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming\nobservations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the\ncontext of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often\ncomputationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse\nobservations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout\nwith on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or\noptimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and\nphysical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We\nwill release code and checkpoints publicly.",

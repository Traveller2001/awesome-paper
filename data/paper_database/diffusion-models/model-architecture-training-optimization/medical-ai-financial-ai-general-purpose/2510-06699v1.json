  "title": "A Diffusion Model for Regular Time Series Generation from Irregular Data\n  with Completion and Masking",
  "summary": "Generating realistic time series data is critical for applications in\nhealthcare, finance, and science. However, irregular sampling and missing\nvalues present significant challenges. While prior methods address these\nirregularities, they often yield suboptimal results and incur high\ncomputational costs. Recent advances in regular time series generation, such as\nthe diffusion-based ImagenTime model, demonstrate strong, fast, and scalable\ngenerative capabilities by transforming time series into image representations,\nmaking them a promising solution. However, extending ImagenTime to irregular\nsequences using simple masking introduces \"unnatural\" neighborhoods, where\nmissing values replaced by zeros disrupt the learning process. To overcome\nthis, we propose a novel two-step framework: first, a Time Series Transformer\ncompletes irregular sequences, creating natural neighborhoods; second, a\nvision-based diffusion model with masking minimizes dependence on the completed\nvalues. This approach leverages the strengths of both completion and masking,\nenabling robust and efficient generation of realistic time series. Our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a relative improvement in\ndiscriminative score by $70\\%$ and in computational cost by $85\\%$.

  "title": "Towards Photonic Band Diagram Generation with Transformer-Latent\n  Diffusion Models",
  "summary": "Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the\nnanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and\nquantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to\ninvestigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.\nHowever, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many\nconfigurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in\noptimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion\nmodels, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three\ndimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which\nextracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent\ndiffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide\ninsights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture\nthe complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving\nthe way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.",

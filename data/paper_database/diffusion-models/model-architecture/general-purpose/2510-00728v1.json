  "title": "Extreme Blind Image Restoration via Prompt-Conditioned Information\n  Bottleneck",
  "summary": "Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but\nfalter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs\nsuffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.\nDirectly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality\n(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to\nunnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel\nframework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We\nfirst learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,\nless-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using\na frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information\ntheory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information\nBottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our\nprojector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a\nlow-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our\nframework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,\nand supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models\nwithout need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation\nregimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.",

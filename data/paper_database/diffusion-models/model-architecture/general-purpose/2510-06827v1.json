  "title": "StyleKeeper: Prevent Content Leakage using Negative Visual Query\n  Guidance",
  "summary": "In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as\npowerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as\nprompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,\nexisting methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of\nthe visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To\naddress this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize\nswapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to\nreduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by\nintentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of\nkey and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple\nyet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we\nprovide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.\nThrough extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method\ndemonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the\nreferences, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code\nis available \\href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.",

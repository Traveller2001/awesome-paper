  "title": "EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models",
  "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of\nmachine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have\nrecently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex\ndata distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,\nrecent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose\nEigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum\nof the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that\nposterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,\nleading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear\nspectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior\ncovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for\nOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace\niteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward\nevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,\nwith up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains\nrobust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing\ndiffusion-based methods often fail.",

  "title": "Leveraging Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model for Person Search",
  "summary": "Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification\nby localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped\nscene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained\nbackbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context\nand fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely\non a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,\nleading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In\nthis paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a\nnovel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating\nthe optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of\ndiffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided\nRegion Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)\nMulti-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and\n(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage\ntext-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on\nCUHK-SYSU and PRW.",

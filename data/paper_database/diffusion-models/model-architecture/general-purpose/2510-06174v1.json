  "title": "Thermodynamic Performance Limits for Score-Based Diffusion Models",
  "summary": "We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models\nand non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on\nentropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the\nnegative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy\nrates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic\ndataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -\nsystem, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the\nthermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon\nand implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects\ngenerative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through\nstochastic thermodynamics.",

  "title": "PepCompass: Navigating peptide embedding spaces using Riemannian\n  Geometry",
  "summary": "Antimicrobial peptide discovery is challenged by the astronomical size of\npeptide space and the relative scarcity of active peptides. Generative models\nprovide continuous latent \"maps\" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore\ndecoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering\nexploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based\nremedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in\npractice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware\nframework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a\nUnion of $\\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\\mathbb{M}^{\\kappa}$, a family\nof decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring\ncomputational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order\nRiemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent\nsecond-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation\nEnumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete\namino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian\nOptimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization.\nFinally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which\ninterpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics,\nbiasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro\nvalidation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel\nseeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active\npeptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial\nstrains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides\na powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.",

  "title": "ESS-Flow: Training-free guidance of flow-based models as inference in\n  source space",
  "summary": "Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or\nto produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks\nwithout retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method\nthat leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in\nflow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space\nusing Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through\nthe generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian\ncomputations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or\nunavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the\ngeneration or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on\ndesigning materials with desired target properties and predicting protein\nstructures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.",

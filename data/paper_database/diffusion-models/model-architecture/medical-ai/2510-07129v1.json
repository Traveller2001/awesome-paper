  "title": "Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image\n  Generation",
  "summary": "Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new\nstandards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains\nchallenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical\nimages feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape\nor texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs\noperate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,\nmaking it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To\naddress this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for\nGraph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding\nto each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features\nand relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer\nmodule and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning\nmechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this\napproach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our\ngenerated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream\nsegmentation tasks. The code is available here.",

  "title": "DP-SNP-TIHMM: Differentially Private, Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Markov\n  Models for Synthesizing Genome-Wide Association Datasets",
  "summary": "Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic\nstudies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs\nwith each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value\nreconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing\nprivacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical\nsummaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require\npost-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or\nselectively share SNPs.\n  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic\nSNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden\nMarkov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure\nthat each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,\nenabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on\nfull SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method\ndirectly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.\n  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\\varepsilon\n\\in [1, 10]$ at $\\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of\nthe HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly\nenhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the\nstatistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the\nprivate sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional\nflexibility and utility.",

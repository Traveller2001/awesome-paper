  "title": "NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse\n  Problems",
  "summary": "Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from\nundersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite\nsolutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,\nprior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or\nlearned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors\ntypically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,\nwe propose \\textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel\nclass of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in\nthe image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection\nof the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two\nkey advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the\nnull-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information\northogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing\nprocess. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,\ncompatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to\nconventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on\nconvergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.\nEmpirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors\nconsistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse\nproblems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed\ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,\nunrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.",

  "title": "Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images",
  "summary": "Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical\nimaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with\nstrong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most\ndata-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and\nstill suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods\navoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median\n(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M\nintroduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent\nsub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional\ninterpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values\ndistorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling\nspace and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is\nemployed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for\nNoise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par\nwith state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently\noutperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an\nefficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the\nfirst step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d.\nassumption.",

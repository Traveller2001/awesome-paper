  "title": "Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival\n  Prediction",
  "summary": "We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural\nnetworks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process\ntheory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion\nprocess to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to\nphysically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and\ndiffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift\nand driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and\ncaptures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.\n  We compare DeepFHT with Cox survival model using synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art\napproaches, while maintaining a physics-based interpretable parameterization\nthat elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination\nof stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for\nmodeling survival phenomena in complex systems.",

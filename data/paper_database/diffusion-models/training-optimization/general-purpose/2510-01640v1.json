  "title": "Joint Deblurring and 3D Reconstruction for Macrophotography",
  "summary": "Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and\n3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.\nHowever, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that\nheavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D\nreconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large\nnumber of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D\nreconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint\ndeblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from\nmulti-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of\nthe object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework\nadopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of\nthe 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from\na small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve\nhigh-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.",

  "title": "ReSWD: ReSTIR'd, not shaken. Combining Reservoir Sampling and Sliced\n  Wasserstein Distance for Variance Reduction",
  "summary": "Distribution matching is central to many vision and graphics tasks, where the\nwidely used Wasserstein distance is too costly to compute for high dimensional\ndistributions. The Sliced Wasserstein Distance (SWD) offers a scalable\nalternative, yet its Monte Carlo estimator suffers from high variance,\nresulting in noisy gradients and slow convergence. We introduce Reservoir SWD\n(ReSWD), which integrates Weighted Reservoir Sampling into SWD to adaptively\nretain informative projection directions in optimization steps, resulting in\nstable gradients while remaining unbiased. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks\nand real-world tasks such as color correction and diffusion guidance show that\nReSWD consistently outperforms standard SWD and other variance reduction\nbaselines.

  "title": "Continual Personalization for Diffusion Models",
  "summary": "Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in\nreal-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel\nlearning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective\napproach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS\nuniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the\ntarget concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while\npreserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept\nneurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of\nprevious concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments,\noutperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization\nworks. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and\nprocessing time for continual personalization.",

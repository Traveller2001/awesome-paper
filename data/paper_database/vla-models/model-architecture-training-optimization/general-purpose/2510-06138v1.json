  "title": "Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning with Language-Encoded Gated Policy\n  Networks",
  "summary": "Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as\nbrief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse\nobjectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned\nmixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task\nmetadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or\nblend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.\nOn MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines\nin success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To\nanalyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies\nobtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate\ncomposes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task\ndescriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that\nnatural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills\nwithin a single policy.",

  "title": "Inefficiencies of Meta Agents for Agent Design",
  "summary": "Recent works began to automate the design of agentic systems using\nmeta-agents that propose and iteratively refine new agent architectures. In\nthis paper, we examine three key challenges in a common class of meta-agents.\nFirst, we investigate how a meta-agent learns across iterations and find that\nsimply expanding the context with all previous agents, as proposed by previous\nworks, performs worse than ignoring prior designs entirely. We show that the\nperformance improves with an evolutionary approach. Second, although the\nmeta-agent designs multiple agents during training, it typically commits to a\nsingle agent at test time. We find that the designed agents have low behavioral\ndiversity, limiting the potential for their complementary use. Third, we assess\nwhen automated design is economically viable. We find that only in a few\ncases--specifically, two datasets--the overall cost of designing and deploying\nthe agents is lower than that of human-designed agents when deployed on over\n15,000 examples. In contrast, the performance gains for other datasets do not\njustify the design cost, regardless of scale.",

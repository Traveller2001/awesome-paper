  "title": "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Scaling Agents for Computer Use",
  "summary": "Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital\ntasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to\nlong-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method\nthat scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among\nthem using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables\nboth wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially\nimproving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method\nestablishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming\nprior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with\ncomprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate\nstrong generalization results to different operating systems on\nWindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the\nunreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective\nscaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN\nprovides a practical framework to achieve this.",

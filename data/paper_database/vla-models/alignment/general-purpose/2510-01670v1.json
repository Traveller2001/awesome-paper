  "title": "Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness",
  "summary": "Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that\ntake actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs\nconsistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals\nregardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize\nthree prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii)\nassumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or\ninfeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these\nthree patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and\nemploys LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement\nwith human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models,\nincluding Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing\nhigh average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle\nrisks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While\nprompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists,\nhighlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions.\nQualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias\n(focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect\n(execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions\ndue to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a\nfoundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk\nand ensuring safe CUA deployment.",

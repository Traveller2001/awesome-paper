  "title": "AIM 2025 Challenge on Real-World RAW Image Denoising",
  "summary": "We introduce the AIM 2025 Real-World RAW Image Denoising Challenge, aiming to\nadvance efficient and effective denoising techniques grounded in data\nsynthesis. The competition is built upon a newly established evaluation\nbenchmark featuring challenging low-light noisy images captured in the wild\nusing five different DSLR cameras. Participants are tasked with developing\nnovel noise synthesis pipelines, network architectures, and training\nmethodologies to achieve high performance across different camera models.\nWinners are determined based on a combination of performance metrics, including\nfull-reference measures (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS), and non-reference ones (ARNIQA,\nTOPIQ). By pushing the boundaries of camera-agnostic low-light RAW image\ndenoising trained on synthetic data, the competition promotes the development\nof robust and practical models aligned with the rapid progress in digital\nphotography. We expect the competition outcomes to influence multiple domains,\nfrom image restoration to night-time autonomous driving.",

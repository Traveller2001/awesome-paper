  "title": "DPA-Net: A Dual-Path Attention Neural Network for Inferring Glycemic\n  Control Metrics from Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Data",
  "summary": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides dense and dynamic glucose\nprofiles that enable reliable estimation of Ambulatory Glucose Profile (AGP)\nmetrics, such as Time in Range (TIR), Time Below Range (TBR), and Time Above\nRange (TAR). However, the high cost and limited accessibility of CGM restrict\nits widespread adoption, particularly in low- and middle-income regions. In\ncontrast, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is inexpensive and widely\navailable but yields sparse and irregular data that are challenging to\ntranslate into clinically meaningful glycemic metrics.\n  In this work, we propose a Dual-Path Attention Neural Network (DPA-Net) to\nestimate AGP metrics directly from SMBG data. DPA-Net integrates two\ncomplementary paths: (1) a spatial-channel attention path that reconstructs a\nCGM-like trajectory from sparse SMBG observations, and (2) a multi-scale ResNet\npath that directly predicts AGP metrics. An alignment mechanism between the two\npaths is introduced to reduce bias and mitigate overfitting. In addition, we\ndevelop an active point selector to identify realistic and informative SMBG\nsampling points that reflect patient behavioral patterns.\n  Experimental results on a large, real-world dataset demonstrate that DPA-Net\nachieves robust accuracy with low errors while reducing systematic bias. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first supervised machine learning framework\nfor estimating AGP metrics from SMBG data, offering a practical and clinically\nrelevant decision-support tool in settings where CGM is not accessible.",

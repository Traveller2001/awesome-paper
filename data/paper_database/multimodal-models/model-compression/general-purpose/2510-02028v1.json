  "title": "LiLa-Net: Lightweight Latent LiDAR Autoencoder for 3D Point Cloud\n  Reconstruction",
  "summary": "This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which\nencodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the\nLiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle,\nequipped with Velodyne LiDAR. The system leverage skip connections concept to\nimprove the performance without using extensive resources as the\nstate-of-the-art architectures. Key changes include reducing the number of\nencoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an\nefficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately\nreconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has\nbeen achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the\nlatent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without\ncompromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization\ncapabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original\ntraffic environment.",

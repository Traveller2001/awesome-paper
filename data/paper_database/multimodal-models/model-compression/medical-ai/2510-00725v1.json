  "title": "DEAP DIVE: Dataset Investigation with Vision transformers for EEG\n  evaluation",
  "summary": "Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to\nachieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and\naffective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a\npromising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and\nfacial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements\nof the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and\nunbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,\nresource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with\nsimplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG\nchannels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion\nprediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped\nEEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data\ninto scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion\nclassification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4\nquadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points\n(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant\nreduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art\nresults of 96,9% with 32 channels.

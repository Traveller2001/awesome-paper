  "title": "TriAlignXA: An Explainable Trilemma Alignment Framework for Trustworthy\n  Agri-product Grading",
  "summary": "The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the\ninability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of\nproduct quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through\n'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality\nis the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in\nagricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,\ntimeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional\nabsolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose\nthe 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from\n'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',\ndesigning the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports\ntrustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through\nmulti-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the\nBio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness\nOptimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization\nEngine for cost control. Additionally, the \"Pre-Mapping Mechanism\" encodes\nprocess data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.\nExperiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than\nbaseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the\nframework's balancing capability in addressing the \"impossible triangle\". This\nresearch provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building\na trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from\nalgorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.",

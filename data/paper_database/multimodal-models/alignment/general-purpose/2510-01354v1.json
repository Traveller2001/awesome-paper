  "title": "WAInjectBench: Benchmarking Prompt Injection Detections for Web Agents",
  "summary": "Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At\nthe same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt\ninjection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents.\nIn this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive\nbenchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We\nbegin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the\nthreat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign\nsamples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text\nsegments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign\nimages from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and\nimage-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across\nmultiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can\nidentify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image\nperturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks\nthat omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our\ndatasets and code are released at:\nhttps://github.com/Norrrrrrr-lyn/WAInjectBench.",

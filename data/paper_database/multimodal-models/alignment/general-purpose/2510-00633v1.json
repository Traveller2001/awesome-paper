  "title": "Virtual Fashion Photo-Shoots: Building a Large-Scale Garment-Lookbook\n  Dataset",
  "summary": "Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual\ntry-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,\neditorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,\nand carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual\nfashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming\nstandardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To\nenable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of\ngarment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.\nBecause such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval\npipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language\nreasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three\ngarment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium\nquality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a\nfoundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward\nfashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.",

  "title": "Introspection in Learned Semantic Scene Graph Localisation",
  "summary": "This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and\nrobustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation\nframework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed\nmaps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether\nthe model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks\nover routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present\na comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights\nconsistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A\nsemantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent\nobjects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model\nlearns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition,\nthereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and\nstructural variations.",

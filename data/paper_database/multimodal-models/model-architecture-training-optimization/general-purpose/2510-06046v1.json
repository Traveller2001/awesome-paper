  "title": "GLVD: Guided Learned Vertex Descent",
  "summary": "Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,\nwhich inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.\nOptimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be\ncomputationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for\n3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent\n(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global\nstructural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating\nrelative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without\nrequiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry\nreconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly\ncompetitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference\ntime.",

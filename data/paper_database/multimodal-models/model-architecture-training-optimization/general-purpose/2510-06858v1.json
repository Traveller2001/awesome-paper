  "title": "Explaining raw data complexity to improve satellite onboard processing",
  "summary": "With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing\ndirectly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints\narise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed\nground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed\nsensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study\ninvestigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for\nobject detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow\nto generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling\nsystemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are\ntrained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using\nstandard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that\nwhile both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the\nmodel trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high\nconfidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved\ncontouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving\nonboard AI for remote sensing.",

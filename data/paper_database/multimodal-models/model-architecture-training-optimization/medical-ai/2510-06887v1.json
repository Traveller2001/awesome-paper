  "title": "Lung Infection Severity Prediction Using Transformers with Conditional\n  TransMix Augmentation and Cross-Attention",
  "summary": "Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can\nescalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity\nprediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical\ndecisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel\nmethod applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung\ninfection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a\nTransformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated\nattention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale\nfeatures; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation\nstrategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image\npatches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and\nPer-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art\ndeep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data\naugmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive\naccuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical\ndiagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning.

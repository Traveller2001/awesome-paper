  "title": "RamPINN: Recovering Raman Spectra From Coherent Anti-Stokes Spectra\n  Using Embedded Physics",
  "summary": "Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific\ndisciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for\ntraining. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body\nof scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of\ngoverning physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering\nRaman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)\nmeasurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating\nnon-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover\nRaman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is\na physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to\ndisentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the\nKramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss\non the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.\nTrained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot\ngeneralization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and\nsignificantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that\ntraining with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any\nground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work\nhighlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent\ninductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited\nscientific domains.",

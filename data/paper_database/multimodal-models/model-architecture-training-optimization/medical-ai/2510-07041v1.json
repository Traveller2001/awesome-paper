  "title": "U-Bench: A Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant\n  Benchmarking",
  "summary": "Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical\nimage segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped\nvariants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive\nbenchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely\nbecause of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of\nefficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We\nprovide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to\nreproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,\nU-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a\nfoundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the\nnext decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

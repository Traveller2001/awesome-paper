  "title": "Self-supervised Physics-guided Model with Implicit Representation\n  Regularization for Fast MRI Reconstruction",
  "summary": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its\nwidespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI\nreconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by\nreconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In\nrecent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress\nin this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches\nproving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are\ndifficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised\nreconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI\nreconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a\nphysics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces\nImplicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively\nconstrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the\npowerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's\ninterpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR\nachieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised\nlearning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.",

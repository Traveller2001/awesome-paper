  "title": "LVLMs as inspectors: an agentic framework for category-level structural\n  defect annotation",
  "summary": "Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring\ninfrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of\nmanual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect\nPattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language\nModels (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative\nself-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific\nprompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data\ninto high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual\nsupervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%\naccuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%\nannotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced\nsettings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework\noffers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset\nconstruction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer\nlearning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.",

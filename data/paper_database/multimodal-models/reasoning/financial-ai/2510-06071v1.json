  "title": "Benchmark It Yourself (BIY): Preparing a Dataset and Benchmarking AI\n  Models for Scatterplot-Related Tasks",
  "summary": "AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet\nbenchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into\nperformance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we\nintroduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six\ndata generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate\nproprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five\ndistinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center\ncoordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,\nespecially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting\nclusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results\nfor localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are\nnear or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).\nFurthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a\nsecondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect\nratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly.

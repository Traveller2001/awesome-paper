  "title": "Automated Structured Radiology Report Generation with Rich Clinical\n  Context",
  "summary": "Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray\nimages offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by\ngenerating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and\nadherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively\nutilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing\nSRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to\ncritical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing\nnon-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose\ncontextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical\ncontext for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive\nclinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical\nindication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding\ncomparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with\nstate-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that\nincorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves\nreport generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints\nto facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at\nhttps://github.com/vuno/contextualized-srrg.",

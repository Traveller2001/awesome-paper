  "title": "Batch-CAM: Introduction to better reasoning in convolutional deep\n  learning models",
  "summary": "Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for\nadvancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as\nhealthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper\nintroduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch\nimplementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction\nloss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,\nthereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results\ndemonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and\nimage reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By\nensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a\nrelevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and\ntrustworthy AI systems.",

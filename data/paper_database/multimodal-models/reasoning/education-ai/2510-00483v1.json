  "title": "MathSticks: A Benchmark for Visual Symbolic Compositional Reasoning with\n  Matchstick Puzzles",
  "summary": "We introduce \\textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic\nCompositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic\nmanipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect\nmatchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under\nstrict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely\nvisual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution\nmultiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a\ncurated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial\nlimitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source\nmodels fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\\% accuracy. These\nfindings establish \\textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing\ncompositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are\npublicly available at https://github.com/Yuheng2000/MathSticks.",

  "title": "Make a Video Call with LLM: A Measurement Campaign over Five Mainstream\n  Apps",
  "summary": "In 2025, Large Language Model (LLM) services have launched a new feature --\nAI video chat -- allowing users to interact with AI agents via real-time video\ncommunication (RTC), just like chatting with real people. Despite its\nsignificance, no systematic study has characterized the performance of existing\nAI video chat systems. To address this gap, this paper proposes a comprehensive\nbenchmark with carefully designed metrics across four dimensions: quality,\nlatency, internal mechanisms, and system overhead. Using custom testbeds, we\nfurther evaluate five mainstream AI video chatbots with this benchmark. This\nwork provides the research community a baseline of real-world performance and\nidentifies unique system bottlenecks. In the meantime, our benchmarking results\nalso open up several research questions for future optimizations of AI video\nchatbots.",

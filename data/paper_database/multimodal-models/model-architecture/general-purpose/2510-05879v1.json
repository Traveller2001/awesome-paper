  "title": "OBSR: Open Benchmark for Spatial Representations",
  "summary": "GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic\npatterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.\nWhile sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are\noften concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As\nsuch, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,\nmodality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper\nintroduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and\nefficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and\ncomprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,\nensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the\nevaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying\ngeographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive\ntask-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for\ncomparing more complex solutions.",

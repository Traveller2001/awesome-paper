  "title": "Generating Surface for Text-to-3D using 2D Gaussian Splatting",
  "summary": "Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential\nfor the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of\nobjects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.\nCurrent methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or\ntrain the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the\nsurfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize\nconditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered\nby 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For\nmulti-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates\ncurvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.\nThrough extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of\nachieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.",

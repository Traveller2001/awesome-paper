  "title": "GeoSURGE: Geo-localization using Semantic Fusion with Hierarchy of\n  Geographic Embeddings",
  "summary": "Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location\nof an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned\nrepresentations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active\nresearch topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning\nthe visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic\nrepresentation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world\nas a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach\nto efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its\nsemantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main\nexperiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics\nmeasured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional\nablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the\ncombination of geographic and visual representations.",

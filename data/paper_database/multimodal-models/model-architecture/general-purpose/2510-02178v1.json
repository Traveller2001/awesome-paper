  "title": "DisCo-Layout: Disentangling and Coordinating Semantic and Physical\n  Refinement in a Multi-Agent Framework for 3D Indoor Layout Synthesis",
  "summary": "3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments.\nTraditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While\nrecent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they\noften lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We\ndevelop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates\nphysical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic\nRefinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the\nPhysical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a\ngrid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework\nintelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement\nrules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment.\nExperiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating\nrealistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be\npublicly available.",

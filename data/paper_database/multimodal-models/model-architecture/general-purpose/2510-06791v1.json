  "title": "Extreme Amodal Face Detection",
  "summary": "Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects\nthat are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an\nexpanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is\npartially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we\nconsider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides\nmotivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our\nmethod specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences\nso that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make\nuse of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we\nconsider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free\napproach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the\npresence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object\ndetector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the\nout-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine\ndecoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even\noutperforming less efficient generative approaches.",

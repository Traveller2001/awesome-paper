  "title": "LLM4Rec: Large Language Models for Multimodal Generative Recommendation\n  with Causal Debiasing",
  "summary": "Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in\nhandling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing\ntransparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced\ngenerative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through\nfive key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented\ngeneration mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable\nrecommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our\nframework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while\nincorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual\nknowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous\nmodel adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\n(MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent\nimprovements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to\nexisting approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in\nNDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.",

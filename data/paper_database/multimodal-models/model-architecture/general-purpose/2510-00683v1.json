  "title": "ProtoMask: Segmentation-Guided Prototype Learning",
  "summary": "XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on\nprototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in\nexplainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc\nsaliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple\ncritiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such\ntechniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation\nfoundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding\nand input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to\na predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such\nvisualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the\nbounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask\nresults in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.\nWe conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets\nwith a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability\ncharacteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates\ncompetitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.\nhttps://github.com/uos-sis/quanproto",

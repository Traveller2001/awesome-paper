  "title": "Concept Retrieval -- What and How?",
  "summary": "A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input\nimage, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central\nconcepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond\nconventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or\nsemantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements,\nand introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach\ngrounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding\nspace typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors\nnecessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this\nneighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure\nthat facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human\nevaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI:\nhttps://pypi.org/project/coret/",

  "title": "StealthAttack: Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting Poisoning via Density-Guided\n  Illusions",
  "summary": "3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As\nthese methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes\ncritical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and\npropose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically\ninjects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly\nvisible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views.\nAdditionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view\nconsistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based\nevaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling\nobjective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nour method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques.\nProject page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/",

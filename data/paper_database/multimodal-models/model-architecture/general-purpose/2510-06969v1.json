  "title": "Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map\n  Construction",
  "summary": "The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a\ncornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,\nparticularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance\ndetection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object\nqueries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the\ninherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose\n\\textbf{MapGR} (\\textbf{G}lobal \\textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD\n\\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a\nglobal representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic\nmodules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the\ndistribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a\ncarefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation\nGuidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,\nglobal-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations\non the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,\ndemonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared\nto leading baselines.",

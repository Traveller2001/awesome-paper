  "title": "Presenting a Paper is an Art: Self-Improvement Aesthetic Agents for\n  Academic Presentations",
  "summary": "The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing\nresearch visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited\nstorytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,\nmaking it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the\nheart of those challenges is a simple principle: \\emph{there is no way to\nimprove it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce\n\\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent\nnarratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via\nvirtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \\textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task\nreinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic\nscoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative\nself-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically\nevaluate the methods, we introduce \\textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a\ncomprehensive benchmark comprising: \\textit{Presentation Generation Quality},\nbuilt on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,\nvideos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \\textit{Aesthetic\nAwareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,\nsupporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and\ncomparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential\nfor agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee\neffective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a\ntrade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL\ntraining shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.",

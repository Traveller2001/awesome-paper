  "title": "Uncovering Overconfident Failures in CXR Models via\n  Augmentation-Sensitivity Risk Scoring",
  "summary": "Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)\ninterpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often\nshow uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not\nreflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on\nconfidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with\nsubtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level\nconsistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose\nan augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify\nerror-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\\pm\n15^\\circ$/$\\pm 30^\\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO\nencoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where\nhighly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)\ndespite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for\nselective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in\nmedical AI.",

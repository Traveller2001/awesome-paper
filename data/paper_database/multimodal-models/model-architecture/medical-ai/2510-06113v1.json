  "title": "Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and\n  Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction",
  "summary": "Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,\nthe models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces\ntheir usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential\nsolution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static\nmatching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic\nalignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an\ninnovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing\ncancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current\nprototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a\nunified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features\nof whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates\ntraceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes\nthree main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges\ncritical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize\nlocal bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that\nsustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to\nadapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype\nmatching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and\ncohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive\nevaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method\nsurpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction\ntechniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective\non prototype learning for critical medical applications.

  "title": "Robust Classification of Oral Cancer with Limited Training Data",
  "summary": "Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a\nparticularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.\nEarly diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist\ndue to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage\nof healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while\npromising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced\nreliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate\noverfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with\nlimited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that\ncombines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for\noral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs\nvariational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty\nquantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by\nsmartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method\nachieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of\nthe training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for\nreal-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations\ndiffering from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior\ngeneralizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%\nfor traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed\nthat the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly\nclassified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified\nsamples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in\ndata-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving\nmodel reliability and generalizability.",

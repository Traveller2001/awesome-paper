  "title": "VarCoNet: A variability-aware self-supervised framework for functional\n  connectome extraction from resting-state fMRI",
  "summary": "Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to\nprecision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual\nvariability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an\nenhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)\nextraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs\nself-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional\ninter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that\ngenerates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the\nabsence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel\naugmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,\nVarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series\nprocessing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our\nVarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject\nfingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii)\nautism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the\nABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our\nextensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning\nmethods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and\ngeneralizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework\nfor FC analysis in rs-fMRI.",

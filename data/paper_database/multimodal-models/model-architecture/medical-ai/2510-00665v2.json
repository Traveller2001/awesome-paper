  "title": "Multi-Domain Brain Vessel Segmentation Through Feature Disentanglement",
  "summary": "The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for\nautomatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging\nmodality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a\ncomprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the\nspecific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain\narteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while\navoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source\nand the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement\ntechniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing\nthem to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.\nSpecifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation\nwhile preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are\ncrucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and\nvaried domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.\nAdditionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required\nannotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our\nframework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain\nadaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in\nmultiple scenarios accurately.

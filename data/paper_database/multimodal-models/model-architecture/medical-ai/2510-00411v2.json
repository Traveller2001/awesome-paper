  "title": "Does Bigger Mean Better? Comparitive Analysis of CNNs and Biomedical\n  Vision Language Modles in Medical Diagnosis",
  "summary": "The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a\ncritical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis\nbetween a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a\nstate-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,\nacross two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST\nbenchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our\nexperiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in\nboth cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we\ndemonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:\ndecision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a\nvalidation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across\nboth datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM\nto achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's\n0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the\nF1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's\n0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for\nleveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match\nor even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.",

  "title": "MoRE-GNN: Multi-omics Data Integration with a Heterogeneous Graph\n  Autoencoder",
  "summary": "The integration of multi-omics single-cell data remains challenging due to\nhigh-dimensionality and complex inter-modality relationships. To address this,\nwe introduce MoRE-GNN (Multi-omics Relational Edge Graph Neural Network), a\nheterogeneous graph autoencoder that combines graph convolution and attention\nmechanisms to dynamically construct relational graphs directly from data.\nEvaluations on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that MoRE-GNN\ncaptures biologically meaningful relationships and outperforms existing\nmethods, particularly in settings with strong inter-modality correlations.\nFurthermore, the learned representations allow for accurate downstream\ncross-modal predictions. While performance may vary with dataset complexity,\nMoRE-GNN offers an adaptive, scalable and interpretable framework for advancing\nmulti-omics integration.",

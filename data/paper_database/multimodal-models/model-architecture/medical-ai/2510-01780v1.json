  "title": "Secure Multi-Modal Data Fusion in Federated Digital Health Systems via\n  MCP",
  "summary": "Secure and interoperable integration of heterogeneous medical data remains a\ngrand challenge in digital health. Current federated learning (FL) frameworks\noffer privacy-preserving model training but lack standardized mechanisms to\norchestrate multi-modal data fusion across distributed and resource-constrained\nenvironments. This study introduces a novel framework that leverages the Model\nContext Protocol (MCP) as an interoperability layer for secure, cross-agent\ncommunication in multi-modal federated healthcare systems. The proposed\narchitecture unifies three pillars: (i) multi-modal feature alignment for\nclinical imaging, electronic medical records, and wearable IoT data; (ii)\nsecure aggregation with differential privacy to protect patient-sensitive\nupdates; and (iii) energy-aware scheduling to mitigate dropouts in mobile\nclients. By employing MCP as a schema-driven interface, the framework enables\nadaptive orchestration of AI agents and toolchains while ensuring compliance\nwith privacy regulations. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets and\npilot clinical cohorts demonstrates up to 9.8\\% improvement in diagnostic\naccuracy compared with baseline FL, a 54\\% reduction in client dropout rates,\nand clinically acceptable privacy--utility trade-offs. These results highlight\nMCP-enabled multi-modal fusion as a scalable and trustworthy pathway toward\nequitable, next-generation federated health infrastructures.",

  "title": "Multimodal Foundation Models for Early Disease Detection",
  "summary": "Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health\nrecords (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable\ndevices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in\nisolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations\nessential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal\nfoundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an\nattention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each\nmodality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head\nattention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining\non many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with\nlittle extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark\ndatasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early\ndetection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management\ntools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency,\nreliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a\nsingle foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the\naccuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions.",

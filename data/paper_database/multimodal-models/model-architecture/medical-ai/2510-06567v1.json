  "title": "The Framework That Survives Bad Models: Human-AI Collaboration For\n  Clinical Trials",
  "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for supporting clinical\ntrials, from patient recruitment and endpoint assessment to treatment response\nprediction. However, deploying AI without safeguards poses significant risks,\nparticularly when evaluating patient endpoints that directly impact trial\nconclusions. We compared two AI frameworks against human-only assessment for\nmedical image-based disease evaluation, measuring cost, accuracy, robustness,\nand generalization ability. To stress-test these frameworks, we injected bad\nmodels, ranging from random guesses to naive predictions, to ensure that\nobserved treatment effects remain valid even under severe model degradation. We\nevaluated the frameworks using two randomized controlled trials with endpoints\nderived from spinal X-ray images. Our findings indicate that using AI as a\nsupporting reader (AI-SR) is the most suitable approach for clinical trials, as\nit meets all criteria across various model types, even with bad models. This\nmethod consistently provides reliable disease estimation, preserves clinical\ntrial treatment effect estimates and conclusions, and retains these advantages\nwhen applied to different populations.",

  "title": "Agentic generative AI for media content discovery at the national\n  football league",
  "summary": "Generative AI has unlocked new possibilities in content discovery and\nmanagement. Through collaboration with the National Football League (NFL), we\ndemonstrate how a generative-AI based workflow enables media researchers and\nanalysts to query relevant historical plays using natural language rather than\ntraditional filter-and-click interfaces. The agentic workflow takes a user\nquery as input, breaks it into elements, and translates them into the\nunderlying database query language. Accuracy and latency are further improved\nthrough carefully designed semantic caching. The solution achieves over 95\npercent accuracy and reduces the average time to find relevant videos from 10\nminutes to 30 seconds, significantly increasing the NFL's operational\nefficiency and allowing users to focus on producing creative content and\nengaging storylines.",

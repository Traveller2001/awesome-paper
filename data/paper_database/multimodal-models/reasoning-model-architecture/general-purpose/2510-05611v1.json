  "title": "MADIAVE: Multi-Agent Debate for Implicit Attribute Value Extraction",
  "summary": "Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately\nrepresenting products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from\nmultimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),\nimplicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data\nand gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce\n\\textsc{\\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM\nagents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,\nagents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference\nperformance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate\nthat even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for\nattributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various\ndebate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and\nanalyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight\nthe potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of\nsingle-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in\nmultimodal e-commerce.",

  "title": "Latency-aware Multimodal Federated Learning over UAV Networks",
  "summary": "This paper investigates federated multimodal learning (FML) assisted by\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with a focus on minimizing system latency and\nproviding convergence analysis. In this framework, UAVs are distributed\nthroughout the network to collect data, participate in model training, and\ncollaborate with a base station (BS) to build a global model. By utilizing\nmultimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems,\nenhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML\nsystem latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling,\npower control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource\nmanagement. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization\nproblem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining\nblock coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which\nprovides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical\nconvergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss\nfunction. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our FML framework outperforms\nexisting approaches in terms of system latency and model training performance\nunder different data settings.",

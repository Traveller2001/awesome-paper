  "title": "Label-frugal satellite image change detection with generative virtual\n  exemplar learning",
  "summary": "Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding\nall the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.\nThe success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is\ntributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the\nacquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this\npaper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.\nThe main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how\nimportant is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most\ncritical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.\nThese exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the\noptimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity\nand ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current\nchange detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in\nthe subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the\npositive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative\nmethods.",

  "title": "Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor\n  Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?",
  "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,\nit requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data\nprivacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm\nthat overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when\ndealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This\nstudy simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity\nnormalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of\nheterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for\nbrain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of\nthe MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training\nand inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to\ninconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of\n92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These\nresults indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing\nmodels without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical\napplications.

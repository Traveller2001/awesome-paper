  "title": "Intuitions of Machine Learning Researchers about Transfer Learning for\n  Medical Image Classification",
  "summary": "Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source\ndatasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus\npatient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than\nsystematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a\ntask-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that\nbenchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI\nperspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate\nthat choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset\nproperties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic\nsimilarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always\naligned, challenging a traditional \"more similar is better\" view. Participants\noften used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions\nand HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,\nthis work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in\ntransfer learning.",

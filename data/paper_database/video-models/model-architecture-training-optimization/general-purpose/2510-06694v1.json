  "title": "SCas4D: Structural Cascaded Optimization for Boosting Persistent 4D\n  Novel View Synthesis",
  "summary": "Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis\nremains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded\noptimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian\nSplatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations\noften exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar\ntransformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level\nto fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time\nframe and produces results comparable to existing methods with only\none-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates\neffectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view\nsynthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.",

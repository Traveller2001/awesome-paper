  "title": "Emergent AI Surveillance: Overlearned Person Re-Identification and Its\n  Mitigation in Law Enforcement Context",
  "summary": "Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort\nrequired to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by\nretrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our\nresearch reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these\nmodels can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets\nwithout human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding\nidentification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while\nthere is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.\nWe evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person\nre-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification\naccuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for\nnon-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these\nmitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.\nThese findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI\ngovernance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems\nwith emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should\nbe required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly\nbenign applications?",

  "title": "CardioBench: Do Echocardiography Foundation Models Generalize Beyond the\n  Lab?",
  "summary": "Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application\nin echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific\nFMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate\nthem. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,\nhigh frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions\nevaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we\nintroduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.\nCardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite\nspanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,\nstructural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several\nleading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose\nencoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our\nresults highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal\nmodeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness\nunder distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture\nphysiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and\noften close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions\nlike view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing\npreprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes\na reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the\ndesign of future echocardiography foundation models.",

  "title": "PAL-Net: A Point-Wise CNN with Patch-Attention for 3D Facial Landmark\n  Localization",
  "summary": "Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a\ntime-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for\nclinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While\nseveral deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark\nlocalization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input\nrepresentations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a\nfully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical\nlandmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse\nalignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of\nlandmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.\nTrained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net\nachieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant\nanatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to\nintra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further\nevaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise\nerror of 0.41\\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\\,mm. Compared to existing\nmethods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh\nquality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy\nacross most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets\nand facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and\nstructural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for\nhigh-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical\nworkflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

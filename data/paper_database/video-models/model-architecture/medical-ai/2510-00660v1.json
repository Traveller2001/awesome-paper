  "title": "Unsupervised Unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA): Deep Interpretable Clutter\n  Filtering for Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging",
  "summary": "High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound\nmicrovascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal\ncomponent analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,\nboth strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow\nseparation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep\nlearning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly\nseparating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised\nfilters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and\nin-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by\nalgorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this\nend, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that\npreserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning\nlabels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least\nsquares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.\nA sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability\nto capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter\nthat is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following\nframes. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo\ndatasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the\nSVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.\nParticularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of\nthe power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated\nthrough ablation studies.",

  "title": "Deep learning motion correction of quantitative stress perfusion\n  cardiovascular magnetic resonance",
  "summary": "Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance\n(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction\nis essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based\nmethods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness\nand scalability.\n  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction\npipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot\nestimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal\ncomponent analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion\nseries and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton\ndensity-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data\nfrom 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via\ntemporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously\npublished registration-based method.\n  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal\nsmoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =\n0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to\nbefore registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed\nreduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)\nml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was\nreduced 15-fold.\n  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion\ncorrection for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and\nauxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences\nand may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.",

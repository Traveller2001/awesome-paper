  "title": "MMDEW: Multipurpose Multiclass Density Estimation in the Wild",
  "summary": "Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and\noccluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a\nmulticategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid\nvision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built\non a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a\nsegmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk\nat training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks\ndemonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting\napproaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11\nunderscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The\nmethod's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,\ndemonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,\nhighlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable\necological insights.",

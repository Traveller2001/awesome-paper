  "title": "When Tracking Fails: Analyzing Failure Modes of SAM2 for Point-Based\n  Tracking in Surgical Videos",
  "summary": "Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot\ntracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the\navailable input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost\nalternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical\nenvironments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze\nthe failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy\nvideos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and\nL-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with\nsegmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is\ncompetitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical\ntargets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking\noutcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and\nplacing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.",

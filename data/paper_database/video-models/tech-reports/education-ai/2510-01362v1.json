  "title": "EvoStruggle: A Dataset Capturing the Evolution of Struggle across\n  Activities and Skill Levels",
  "summary": "The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is\ncrucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of\neffective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of\nstruggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to\ndetermining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing\nmanipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In\nthis work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68\nhours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle\nsegments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped\ninto four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and\nshuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,\nparticipants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of\nskill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action\nlocalization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle\nsegments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal\nAction Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even\nwhen evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall\naverage mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across\nactivities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various\nskill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in\nstruggle detection.

  "title": "Bridged Clustering for Representation Learning: Semi-Supervised Sparse\n  Bridging",
  "summary": "We introduce Bridged Clustering, a semi-supervised framework to learn\npredictors from any unpaired input $X$ and output $Y$ dataset. Our method first\nclusters $X$ and $Y$ independently, then learns a sparse, interpretable bridge\nbetween clusters using only a few paired examples. At inference, a new input\n$x$ is assigned to its nearest input cluster, and the centroid of the linked\noutput cluster is returned as the prediction $\\hat{y}$. Unlike traditional SSL,\nBridged Clustering explicitly leverages output-only data, and unlike dense\ntransport-based methods, it maintains a sparse and interpretable alignment.\nThrough theoretical analysis, we show that with bounded mis-clustering and\nmis-bridging rates, our algorithm becomes an effective and efficient predictor.\nEmpirically, our method is competitive with SOTA methods while remaining\nsimple, model-agnostic, and highly label-efficient in low-supervision settings.",

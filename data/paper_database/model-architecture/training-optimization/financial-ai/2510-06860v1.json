  "title": "Towards Generalization of Graph Neural Networks for AC Optimal Power\n  Flow",
  "summary": "AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) is computationally expensive for large-scale\npower systems, with conventional solvers requiring prohibitive solution times.\nMachine learning approaches offer computational speedups but struggle with\nscalability and topology adaptability without expensive retraining. To enable\nscalability across grid sizes and adaptability to topology changes, we propose\na Hybrid Heterogeneous Message Passing Neural Network (HH-MPNN). HH-MPNN models\nbuses, generators, loads, shunts, transmission lines and transformers as\ndistinct node or edge types, combined with a scalable transformer model for\nhandling long-range dependencies. On grids from 14 to 2,000 buses, HH-MPNN\nachieves less than 1% optimality gap on default topologies. Applied zero-shot\nto thousands of unseen topologies, HH-MPNN achieves less than 3% optimality gap\ndespite training only on default topologies. Pre-training on smaller grids also\nimproves results on a larger grid. Computational speedups reach 1,000x to\n10,000x compared to interior point solvers. These results advance practical,\ngeneralizable machine learning for real-time power system operations.",

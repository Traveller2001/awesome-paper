  "title": "QGraphLIME - Explaining Quantum Graph Neural Networks",
  "summary": "Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on\ngraph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by\nmeasurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph\nstructure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a\nmodel-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as\ndistributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations\nof a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their\ndispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance\nrankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a\ndistribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate\nensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of\nthe induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and\nconfidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on\ncontrolled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and\nstable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear\nsurrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.\nCollectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and\nstructure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and\nlay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world\ndatasets, as quantum resources mature.
